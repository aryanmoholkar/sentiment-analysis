Hedge fund manager and author Brian Kelly sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli to talk about bitcoin. The digital currency was created after the 2009 financial crisis and is now worth more than $1,000 each. If you are a baby boomer you buy gold, if you are a millennial you buy bitcoin, said Kelly. The millennials that I talk to don't trust gold, but do trust math (bitcoin). The author of The Bitcoin Big Bang â€” How Alternative Currencies are About to Change the World breaks down the basics of how digital currencies work and explains how investors can get in on the action.
