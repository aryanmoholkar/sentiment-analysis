Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty said the new iPhone from Apple later this year will be so innovative that a rush of people will upgrade, driving much higher sales than the rest of Wall Street currently expects. "We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated," Huberty told CNBC PRO in an exclusive interview. The analyst projects 20 percent unit growth for the iPhone in fiscal 2018, double Wall Street's current 10 percent growth estimate. Huberty said her "bull case" calls for 30 percent unit growth in the period. She joined Morgan Stanley in 2000 and is a member of the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team.
