### TITLE: 
These stores will survive the destruction of the American mall, Morgan Stanley's retail guru says

### TEXT: 
Kimberly Greenberger, Morgan Stanley's retail guru, said the department store business model anchored in malls is fundamentally flawed in this online era, yet there is a group of brick-and-mortar retailers that can still thrive.

"If a retail store simply sells other people's brands that's a business model that's more at risk ... because Amazon and some of the other pure-play retailers can sell other people's brands potentially better," Greenberger told Mike Santoli in an exclusive interview for CNBC PRO.

But the off-price retailers should do well, she said.

"They really perform an inventory clearance function and most of the brands that need to clear inventory don't want to see that inventory show up online so there's a real need for these stores and they serve a real purpose and they also help the brands clear out their mistakes," she said, noting the firm has a buy rating on Ross Stores and Burlington Stores and an equal-weight rating on TJX because of this trend.

Greenberger is the No. 1-ranked retail analyst on Wall Street according to Institutional Investor and has been covering the industry for 17 years. She also discusses:

Why retail will never be 100 percent online.

Why retail stock valuations have been permanently reset lower.

What the effect will be of a Trump BAT tax.

The interview is exclusively for CNBC PRO subscribers.

### TITLE: 
Economist Pomboy says stocks are in a bubble, buy gold and bonds

### TEXT: 
Economist Stephanie Pomboy said she believes the stock market is in a bubble because economic growth will not live up to expectations and because any federal stimulus from President Donald Trump, if it even comes to be, will be mostly canceled out by tax increases and spending cuts on the state and local level.

"I think the stock market fits that definition" of a bubble, Pomboy told CNBC's Mike Santoli in an interview. "As an economist I look at stock market valuation by taking total stock market cap relative to GDP and we're right back where we were in 2000 at the peak ... I struggle with the idea that the stock market has a lot of upside room barring some spontaneous acceleration in growth, which sort of strikes me as unlikely."

Pomboy is founder of MacroMavens, a macroeconomic research firm which gave early warnings on the housing crisis. Before founding MacroMavens in 2002, Pomboy worked with Ed Hyman at ISI Group.

Investors should buy gold and Treasurys in order to ride out the coming pullback, Pomboy said.

"I just buy gold. It's kind of the easy way out on trying to figure out which currency is going to win the ugly contest," she said.

In this exclusive interview for CNBC PRO, Pomboy also comments on:

### TITLE: 
Looming European political crisis is actually a buying opportunity, Tim Seymour says

### TEXT: 
Investors around the world, including those in the U.S., are on edge about the political calendar in Europe. The U.K. starts the official Brexit process on March 29. The French presidential election, where a far-right candidate in Marine Le Pen has a small chance to win, takes place in late April.

But Tim Seymour believes all this tension is a buying opportunity no matter the outcomes, just like it was for U.S. stocks before the surprise election of Donald Trump.

"I'm not going to be dismissive of the risks, but I think markets have priced them in and if anything as we look at the fundamentals of stock markets around the world, the fundamentals of European equities right now are I think significantly better than they are for the United States," said the managing partner of Triogem Asset Management and global investing expert on CNBC's "Fast Money."

Other topics discussed in this exclusive interview with Mike Santoli for CNBC PRO include:

### TITLE: 
Here's what Warren Buffett's hero Jack Bogle is most worried about in the markets right now

### TEXT: 




Jack Bogle, founder of the Vanguard group and creator of the first index fund, told CNBC PRO he is worried that just three firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — dominate the passive investing game. He believes more firms need to embrace the passive philosophy and reduce the influence of these companies, including his own.

He believes more firms need to embrace the passive philosophy and reduce the influence of these companies, including his own.

"I've also been in this business so long that I know that when everything looks sweet and easy, you better be worried 'cause the big guy hidden in the back of the room — you can't see him — huge, strapping guy carrying a sledgehammer and just when you think everything is going fine he takes that sledgehammer back and hits you in the nape of the neck," Bogle told Mike Santoli in the exclusive interview.

Overall, Bogle remains concerned about Wall Street's constant habit of putting itself before its customers and that active management mutual fund firms which are also publicly traded will continue to suffer from this conflict of interest.

"The industry structure I think is going to have to change in a more mutual direction where the client comes first and not the investment manager and particularly not the financial conglomerates that own 30 of the 50 largest mutual fund companies," Bogle said.

Warren Buffett called Bogle a "hero" to him in his annual letter released this year, writing, "If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands down choice should be Jack Bogle."

On this comment from the "Oracle of Omaha," Bogle said, "When a hero like Warren calls me a hero, there may be an element of truth in it, but one takes these things with a grain of salt."

Bogle, 87, also discusses in this nearly 20 minute sit-down:

How much bigger passive investing can get (It's 22 percent of the market now).



The origin of his index fund idea.

Why some ETFs don't belong in 401(k)s.

What returns investors can expect over the next decade

### TITLE: 
The biggest bull on Wall Street explains why the run has up to 4 more years to go

### TEXT: 
Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank's chief global strategist, told CNBC PRO that the equity bull market and economic expansion have up to four more years to go.

"The historical drivers of productivity are pretty well aligned to get a pickup and a good solid inflection in productivity," explained Chadha, while listing his reasons for being so bullish. "The U.S. dollar up-cycle has still got another 10 percent to go over the medium term and that will take the edge off inflation and really prolong the cycle."

"I would argue two to four years, probably three ... maybe a little longer" to go, he added.

Chadha is the most bullish strategist on Wall Street with a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 2,600, representing a 9 percent gain from Wednesday's close.

The strategist, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University, also discusses :

Why the bond market is in a bubble



Why he's long financials, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks

Why President Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus may not help the market

This exclusive chat with CNBC's Mike Santoli is only available to CNBC PRO subscribers.

### TITLE: 
Morgan Stanley's technology analyst is super bullish on Apple, sees major improvements in the new iPhone

### TEXT: 
Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty said the new iPhone from Apple later this year will be so innovative that a rush of people will upgrade, driving much higher sales than the rest of Wall Street currently expects.

"We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated," Huberty told CNBC PRO in an exclusive interview. "What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence."

The analyst projects 20 percent unit growth for the iPhone in fiscal 2018, double Wall Street's current 10 percent growth estimate. Huberty said her "bull case" calls for 30 percent unit growth in the period.

Huberty, who also covers IBM, has one of the best track records among analysts on Wall Street, with her picks posting an average one-year return of 12.6 percent since 2009, according to TipRanks, a Wall Street tracking service. She joined Morgan Stanley in 2000 and is a member of the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team.

Also in her discussion with CNBC's Michael Santoli, Huberty talks about:

The best cloud-computing plays

Why IBM is a top play on artificial intelligence

Why Apple will have a big year in China

Why investing in technology is "thematic"

### TITLE: 
Vanguard's CIO Tim Buckley on why active investing is a losing game

### TEXT: 
Mortimer J. "Tim" Buckley, Vanguard's chief investment officer, who is leading the latest wave of passive investing that got started under Vanguard's founder and former CEO Jack Bogle, joined CNBC PRO for an educational interview on money management and the evolution of investing.



"In the '80s, only about 30 percent of assets were professionally managed, so professionals could go out against amateurs and basically steal alpha. Today you are over 70 percent, getting on 80 percent professionally managed. Now you have pro against pro," Buckley said.

Given the rise of technology over the past three decades, which has facilitated the flow of information, the CIO says active investing is a losing game for most active managers.

"Now I have to be better than someone else who's got their CFA, their Bloomberg terminal and all the flow of information; they're watching CNBC; they've got all of this information flowing in. ... It's a much tougher game to find alpha," Buckley said.

The statistics back up this claim, with a recent report from the Financial Times showing that nearly all professional actively managed U.S. equity funds sold in Europe, for example, have underperformed their benchmarks since 2006. Similar statistics are seen in the United States.

In this exclusive conversation with CNBC's Michael Santoli, Buckley, who helps oversee about $4 trillion in investor assets managed by Vanguard, also discusses:

Why fees and other costs are investors' biggest enemy.

Trends in money flows and where funds are being deployed.

How to build a portfolio for retirement and beyond.

Investment lessons and principles every market participant must know.

Top chart analyst Chris Verrone reveals his No. 1 buy signal, other tips

### TEXT: 
Technical analyst Chris Verrone joined CNBC's Mike Santoli for an educational strategy session on how he spots winning investment opportunities using charts.



"We look for examples where securities may be acting differently than the fundamental work might suggest," he said.



As an example, Verrone points to the divergence that occurred last year between interest rates and financials stocks.



"When something doesn't go down when it should, the story or the trend may be changing. I thought last summer was a great example. You had bond yields at record lows, but quickly the banks started to act better. That was a sign to us that a group or security was becoming immune to news that should have hurt it. Banks should've gone lower with lower yields," Verrone said.



In this conversation, Verrone first shares his investment approach and then he uses some of his favorite charts to explain how investors can use technical analysis to their advantage.



Verrone is head of technical analysis at Strategas Research Partners, an independent institutional brokerage firm. He's been ranked among the top technical analysts on Wall Street in the annual All-America Research Survey by Institutional Investor Magazine.

### TITLE: 
Wells Fargo strategist Wren says market to stall on DC gridlock, but this strategy will still work

### TEXT: 
Overall equity returns this year could stall in the months ahead as investors temper their enthusiasm around the speed of economic reform promised by President Donald Trump, which is likely to take time, according to Scott Wren.



"I think the new administration will have very little to do with what happens in the economy in 2017. It's more of a 2018, 2019, 2020 story. And that's what we're trying to talk to our clients about," said the senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.



"Many of them, those at least that were enthused with the result of the election, keep thinking, '4 percent growth, 5 percent growth,' they keep hearing these big numbers. And we're telling them that that's not going to happen. This is going to be a modest growth, modest inflation year," he added.



Wells Fargo Investment Institute serves clients of the company's wealth and investment management division, which has $1.7 trillion in assets.



In this exclusive strategy session, Wren sits down with CNBC's Mike Santoli to explain how the firm is advising clients to beat subpar market returns and position themselves for growth this year.



Some of the topics covered include:



The market dynamics that could derail the rally.

Whether investors should look for growth overseas.

His favorite investment ideas for 2017.

The one mistake retail investors have made since 2009.

### TITLE: 
Investing columnist Jason Zweig on the big advantage small investors have over the pros

### TEXT: 
Jason Zweig, a best-selling author and investing columnist for The Wall Street Journal, sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli for an in-depth discussion on the psychology of investing, the traits of successful investors and why the average investor is actually better off than the pros.



"If you're an individual investor, you have a massive advantage over professional investors, which is nobody's looking over your shoulder, except maybe your spouse or your significant other or your partner," Zweig said.

"And that cripples professional investors. And you don't have that cinder block tied to your ankles with a steel chain. You can judge your success by your own standards. And you can set your own time horizon. And I constantly urge people, think in terms of decades or generations rather than days or weeks or months or years," he added.

Zweig is the author of "The Devil's Financial Dictionary," among other books, and edited the revised edition of Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor," the classic text that Warren Buffett has described as "by far the best book about investing ever written."

In this exclusive interview, Zweig outlines the driving forces behind decision-making when it comes to money and investing and also discusses:

Why smart people "turn stupid" when money is involved

How investors can overcome counterproductive psychological quirks

The future of active vs. passive investing

Ben Graham's theories on value investing and whether they are still relevant

### TITLE: 
Veteran Wall Street strategist Stovall says market close to overvalued, but certain stocks are still cheap

### TEXT: 
Sam Stovall, a veteran Wall Street strategist known for his study of market patterns, sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli for an in-depth interview on the various principles he uses to predict market returns and evaluate stocks.

Stovall explains why he believes the S&P 500 should be trading at around 2,340, or only about 2 percent higher from here.

"The reason we haven't stumbled with a P/E so high at this point is, we've had inflation in the low 2 percent area. So as a result, we can stand higher valuations when inflation itself is lower," he said.

In this exclusive conversation, Stovall, who first joined Standard & Poor's in 1989 and now serves as chief investment strategist at CFRA, defends his market-timing methods against the passive investing onslaught.

"The reason why history works is because one element has been consistent throughout the beginning of time and that is human reaction," Stovall said.

Other topics include:

His 'Rule of 20' method for evaluating stocks.

The best way to determine sector allocations.

Whether emerging markets could outperform developed markets this year.

Active versus passive investing and how to choose a management style.

The various ways retail investors can stay ahead of the curve by using history as a guide.

Hedge fund manager Brian Kelly on the future of digital currencies and how to invest in them

### TEXT: 
Hedge fund manager and author Brian Kelly sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli to talk about bitcoin. The digital currency was created after the 2009 financial crisis and is now worth more than $1,000 each.



"If you are a baby boomer you buy gold, if you are a millennial you buy bitcoin," said Kelly. "The millennials that I talk to don't trust gold, but do trust math (bitcoin)."

The investor was referring to a 2015 study from Goldman Sachs that showed 63 percent of millennials don't own a credit card and a third said they won't need a bank in five years. Bitcoin will fill the void, Kelly said.

The author of "The Bitcoin Big Bang — How Alternative Currencies are About to Change the World" breaks down the basics of how digital currencies work and explains how investors can get in on the action.

In this exclusive conversation, Kelly, a regular panelist on CNBC's "Fast Money," also shares his views on the U.S. dollar, currency wars, oil, his investment approach and much more.

Top-rated financial advisor Andy Chase on the best investment for 2017

### TEXT: 
Stocks remain the best place to invest in 2017 and beyond, as compelling valuations show the market has further room to run, according to Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management's Andy Chase, who oversees more than $20 billion in assets for investors.

"If you don't have the guts to be entirely in real estate, which I think is more in the eighth or ninth inning, I think stocks are still in the third or fourth inning, which nobody is talking about because I think multiples should be much, much higher," Chase told CNBC PRO.

"I look at stocks as the only asset class, frankly, that hasn't had price inflation. It's actually extremely cheap relative to bonds," Chase added.

He was selected by Barron's in 2016 as the top financial advisor in the United States, after a 30-year career in wealth management.

In this exclusive strategy session hosted by CNBC's Mike Santoli, Chase reveals his approach to investing and also discusses:

Where to find value in the stock market.

How to make sense of the investment landscape under Trump.

His favorite portfolio allocations for the months ahead.

Active vs. passive investing.

Whether 'robo-advisors' work.

Credit Suisse's Michael Mauboussin on spotting market inefficiencies to beat the market

### TEXT: 
Michael Mauboussin, head of global financial strategies at Credit Suisse and author of four books on investing, joined CNBC's Mike Santoli for an exclusive strategy session on how investors can outperform the market by spotting trading inefficiencies.

One of those inefficiencies includes finding overly bullish or overly bearish sentiment in a security, which often reflects herd mentality and causes investors to put down their guard.

"So everyone seems to be on the same side of a ship. They're all uniformly bullish. They're all uniformly bearish. And that becomes much more sort of a sociological or social psychological component," Mauboussin said.

In this extensive conversation, Mauboussin, who has taught at Columbia Business School since 1993, also discusses:



The benefits of active management.

How established money managers and institutions approach investing.

Some of the common mistakes retail investors make and how to avoid them.

His outlook for the hedge fund industry.

Seth Masters, who oversees $80 billion in assets at Bernstein Private Wealth Management, predicts U.S. market returns will be much more difficult to achieve in the years ahead.



"After now about six or seven years of a very healthy equity market recovery, U.S. stocks are no longer cheap," Masters said. "Profit margins at U.S. companies remain at very elevated levels. It's hard to see how you get huge earnings growth or much more valuation expansion here in the U.S."

In contrast, Masters believes investors will need to turn their attention overseas for opportunities where better valuations and higher-growth potential still exists.

"It's going to be a little tougher to get good returns and manage risk in the years ahead. It was easier when the dollar was strong just to stay here at home. When you have stronger equity returns outside the U.S., but possibly weaker currencies, you need to have pretty nuanced strategies to take advantage of that," he said.

Masters famously predicted in 2012 that the Dow Jones industrial average would rise to 20,000 by 2018, a forecast that caused a stir because the blue-chip benchmark was around only 12,500 at the time.

In an extensive strategy session with CNBC's Mike Santoli, Masters reveals his outlook for 2017 and discusses:

How investors should position their portfolios in the months ahead

The investment principles that could drive returns in 2017

Equity allocations by region, and where to find opportunities

Investment lessons for every market participant

Fixed income strategies and how to protect one's portfolio against unexpected market swings.

Charles Schwab's chief strategist Liz Ann Sonders sees 'slow melt-up' in 2017

### TEXT: 
Liz Ann Sonders, who sets the tone for $2.7 trillion of investors' assets as chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, shares her investment outlook for 2017 during an extensive strategy session with CNBC's Mike Santoli.

"I don't put all the credit on the results of the election for the rally in the stock market," said Sonders, who thinks a solid foundation for stocks was already in place given the positive trend in economic data and a bottom in corporate earnings.

"If you look at the improvement in the economic data, it predated the election. So that the bottom in, say, the Economic Surprise Index put out by Citigroup, occurred in mid-October. So I think some of this move reflects the economic data and earnings data having already approved at this point," she said.

She said just as in 2016, there could be a "slow melt-up" for stocks this year, and investors can profit from it by seeking value strategies.

"Fundamentally, I think value makes sense, just don't put blinders on in terms of where you find that value," Sonders said.

Other topics they discussed include:

Her favorite sectors and asset allocations for 2017

The investment strategies that make most sense for investors

Investor sentiment measures and what those metrics show

Market valuations, her outlook for earnings, yields and fixed income

Top-ranked media analyst: 'Never bet against the American couch potato'

### TEXT: 
Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, one of the top-ranked media analysts on Wall Street, says changes in consumption habits over the past decade have only reinforced his view that Americans will remain big consumers of entertainment content.

"I've been covering this sector for 17 years. And one thing I always half-jokingly say to investors when they're ready to assume everything's going to zero is: Never bet against the American couch potato, because our desire to consume and actually spend money on content has continued to surprise to the upside," Swinburne said during an in-depth conversation with CNBC's Michael Santoli.

Consumers haven't given up television, but instead are watching shows on demand through their tablets and other media devices, he said. And now they are buying services such as Netflix and Hulu on top of their cable subscriptions, the analyst added.

During this exclusive talk, Swinburne also discusses:



His investment outlook for the media industry under President-elect Donald Trump.

JPMorgan asset management global strategist: 'Animal spirits' trump fundamentals during this rally

### TEXT: 
David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.8 trillion, said investors may need to rethink how they value stocks during this euphoric market rally on President-elect Donald Trump's promises of pro-growth economic policies.

"The economic data was going to be fine regardless of who got elected president. What I feel like Trump's election has done is brought out some animal spirits. And that's why you are seeing small caps, which are up significantly since Nov. 8, you are seeing a further rally in the banks, the materials, the industrial names. There was underlying support from the fundamentals as it was, but now we got sentiment on our side," Lebovitz said.

In this in-depth interview, Lebovitz discusses:



The main changes taking place in the investment landscape.

Best places to invest in 2017, including stocks, bonds and global markets.

Some of the key economic factors needed to keep the rally going.

Why long-term investors should add exposure to health-care stocks.

### TITLE: 
Epoch's Priest, manager of more than $40 billion, says investors may need to temper Trump enthusiasm

### TEXT: 
William Priest, chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Epoch Investment Partners, said investors may need to temper expectations for big economic growth under President-elect Donald Trump.

Priest, whose firm manages more than $40 billion, told Mike Santoli in an exclusive interview:

"You're going to have a very difficult time getting real growth to be more than 2 percent except, perhaps, through a cyclical phenomenon. Let's say, for example, you have a huge fiscal program that might run $200, $300 billion a year. That'll move the needle on real GDP. But we're almost a $19 trillion economy. It's not going to move it that much. There may be a multiplier with it, which would help. But the reality is if you get us to 2.5 percent that would be a lot. Four percent, I'm afraid, is impractical if not impossible."



On globalization, the investor warned of the risks associated with trying to interfere with free capital markets. As an example, he references the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, a law that raised U.S. tariffs on more than 20,000 imported products to record levels.

"If you really want to stop global trade, that's analogous to Smoot–Hawley. Smoot-Hawley is often considered a factor that led to the Great Depression. And I'm not forecasting a great depression. But there's a reason why trade works. And it's if it benefits both parties," he said.

In this in-depth conversation, Priest, who started his first investment firm in the early 1970s and then later sold it to Credit Suisse, also discusses:

Why the end of P/E expansion may be near.

Changes in the investment landscape.

The factors that could support the stock market.

How to succeed in active management.

UBS strategist Emanuel says Trump to spark a revival in active investing next year

### TEXT: 
The pro-growth agenda of President-elect Donald Trump will spark a revival in active investing, according to UBS equity and derivatives strategist Julian Emanuel, who shared his 2017 investment playbook with CNBC PRO.



"The change in [market] psychology is very profound ... to us, it's essentially getting away from eight years of worrying about zero interest rates as the guiding principle for alpha generation, for searching for yield and for stock selection, which actually has also led to more passive investment," Emanuel said in the exclusive interview.



In 2017 and beyond, however, a resetting of interest rates along with pro-growth economic policies proposed by Trump should result in investment opportunities for stock pickers.

"The active managers that we speak with who've had their head down for the last several years are for the first time showing smiles on their faces. The game in our view has changed for the medium term," Emanuel said.

In this in-depth conversation with CNBC's Mike Santoli, Emanuel, who has more than two decades of investment experience, also discusses:

How to profit from changes in the investment landscape.

The likely winners and losers from the rise in interest rates.

The best sectors to own in 2017.

S&P's index guru David Blitzer on passive investing, market valuation and Trump-Reagan comparisons

### TEXT: 
David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, spoke at length with CNBC's Mike Santoli about passive investing, how to value the market and what may be ahead under President-elect Donald Trump.



"One comment that's come up a few times and maybe it's looking at the individual as much as anything else, but there seems to be an interest to compare Reagan and Trump together," said Blitzer in reference to the similarities between both politicians.

Despite those comparisons, the path ahead for the incumbent president may not be as rosy, according to Blitzer:

"Reagan's economic policy — very different than what we have now in a sense — was very tight monetary policy. Paul Volcker was in the Fed. They just crashed down on inflation. And it was still very tight. When Reagan came into office, interest rates were probably 15 percent, 16 percent, which shocks people today. On the other hand, you know, Reagan said he was going to balance the budget. But he didn't. And I don't think Mr. Trump has said he is going to balance the budget. But it'd be very difficult for anybody to balance the budget today. So if he looks like Reagan, we're going to flip everything around," he said.

In this exclusive conversation for PRO subscribers, Blitzer, who's been ranked by Smart Money magazine as one of the 30 most influential people in the world of investing, also discusses:

How new index members are selected.

Trends in the housing market.

Inflation, valuations and his outlook for stocks.

Behavioral economics expert Dan Ariely on Trump's 'irrational' win and the market's response

### TEXT: 
Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University who's widely considered one of the most prominent leaders in the field of behavioral economics, shared his perspective on the surprise presidential victory of Donald Trump, how investors can improve their returns and a simple method consumers can use to save money.

"There's probably never been a better period in life to represent the irrational side of human decision-making," Ariely said during his wide-ranging conversation with CNBC's Michael Santoli, in reference to the outcome of the U.S. presidential race.

One of the explanations presented by the professor is fear, a powerful emotion that's ingrained in humans' genetic makeup and can impair rational thinking.

"I think people are afraid of what's happening in the job market, poverty, having difficulty to pay bills, rising health care expenses," he said.

"And those emotions are taking over. And it's very easy to sit here and say: Oh, people should take the costs and benefits into account and they should really do something calculated. But the moment people are fearful, we don't get at that point. You're just afraid, you want to close down. This is why it's so easy to hate," he added.

Ariely, who's the author of three New York Times best-selling books, also discusses:



Making sense of Trump's surprise victory

Understanding behavioral patterns that can help you become a better investor

How to approach personal finance and save more

What drives motivation and performance

The psychology behind investing and how to avoid the most common pitfalls

Top financial blogger turned ETF manager: Keep investing simple

### TEXT: 
Financial blogger Eddy Elfenbein, whose annual list of 20 stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight of the last nine years, spoke with CNBC PRO about the simple investment principles he uses to select winning stocks.

"I think too often investors get too buried in the numbers and P/E ratios. What all those numbers reflect is, is this an outstanding company? Is this a company that has a consistent track record of growing their earnings, growing their sales? Do they have their balance sheet under control? That's really what you want to get to," Elfenbein said during the in-depth conversation with CNBC's Mike Santoli.



Because of his strong track record, Elfenbein was able to launch his investment approach as an exchange-traded fund in September, the AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF. His blog is Crossing Wall Street.

Top-rated fund manager on long-term investing: Be willing to hold a stock for 8 years

### TEXT: 
Andrew Peck, a top-rated portfolio manager of the Baron Asset Fund, a mid-cap growth fund that's generated annualized returns of 12 percent the last five years, sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli at the Baron Investment Conference in New York to discuss his approach to long-term investing.



The money manager explains that the typical investment in his fund is held for an average of eight years, a key feature that's allowed him to outperform his peers, in his opinion.

"When I am contemplating a new investment, the question I'm asking myself is, what type of company can I identify that I would feel comfortable owning for that period of time?," he said.

During that analysis, he thinks there are certain characteristics that can help investors identify long-term opportunities. One of them relates to ensuring a company has a "meaningful and sustainable competitive advantage."

"Is the company doing something truly differentiated, and do we think that differentiating factor can persist for an extended period?" he said.

In this wide-ranging interview, Peck, who manages $2.5 billion in assets and has more than 20 years of investing experience, also discusses:

How to identify sustainable investment opportunities.

His favorite stocks for long-term investors.

One of the mistakes investors make when valuing stocks.

Steve Rattner on the investing landscape after the election

### TEXT: 
Steven Rattner, chairman of Willett Advisors, the investment arm for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's personal and philanthropic assets, sat down with CNBC's Mike Santoli to discuss the investing landscape after the U.S. presidential election.



"I think if I were the market, what I might want would be some form of divided government, but one in which stuff actually gets done, as opposed to a divided government in which nothing gets done. I think in terms of investing around it, the market has made it clear that it prefers Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, which is an unusual choice for the market. But as you watch the market go up and down with the polls, I think that's relatively clear," said Rattner.

"So if Mr. Trump were to win, I think you would see a massive downturn in the market the next day, at this point. If Hillary Clinton wins, probably not that much of an upturn," he added.

In this wide-ranging conversation, Rattner, who previously served as counselor to the secretary of the Treasury and led the Obama administration's effort to restructure the automobile industry, also discusses:

The fiscal priorities of a new administration.

Whether Democrats are the new party for business.

His outlook for General Motors, Ford and the auto industry.

Scott Black says market is '10 to 15% overvalued,' reveals where to find opportunities

### TEXT: 
Value investor Scott Black, the founder of Delphi Management, a money management firm he started in 1980, says extended valuations could keep the market at bay.

"Even if you've factored in a 10 percent increase [in earnings] next year to $120 or $121, you're still looking at the high 17s on a multiple basis ... the historical norm is about a 16 P/E, which says that the market is maybe 10 to 15 percent overvalued," Black told CNBC's Mike Santoli during this exclusive interview.

"Now, let's look at the homogeneous classes of small and mid cap. The Russell 2000 right now is 27 times earnings, and the Russell 2500 is 25 times earnings. I mean, these are nosebleed territories. So, again, you have to rely on individual stock selection," the money manager said.

In this wide-ranging conversation, Black, who has over 40 years of financial and investing experience, reveals his top investment ideas, and discusses:

One of the top fund managers of the decade is holding triple his normal cash position

### TEXT: 
Jerry Dodson, founder and lead portfolio manager of Parnassus Investments, an independent investment management firm with about $20 billion under management, believes market participants may be running out of investment options due to high valuations.

"Right now the cash holdings of the Parnassus Endeavor Fund are 15 percent. Usually we like to have maybe 5 percent. But what's happening is, we are not able to find undervalued companies," said Dodson. "And the difficulty we think is that the market is fully valued."

The Parnassus Endeavor Fund is the top-performing large cap growth fund over the last three, five and 10 years, according to Morningstar. The fund is up 11 percent this year alone.

Stephen Weiss: Here's your hedge fund investment setup for the week ahead

### TEXT: 
Week in Review:

What makes a super hero? Invincibility? Super-human strength? Resilience – the ability to shake off adversity? All of the above! Superheroes are magnetic, drawing in the masses, exuding a confidence that others glom onto, comforted by a sense that ultimately all will be okay, even, if at a particular point, it seems that the chips are stacked against a positive outcome. I'm not talking about complacency; nope, that would evidence a lack of any concern at any time; that would be boring.

Does any of that sound familiar? Of course it does – all of it. I'm not channeling Superman or even the more believable Stallone, circa Rocky I. I'm talking equities and treasuries. A hawkish Fed? No match for the markets. D.C. gridlock, both interparty and intraparty? Swatted away like a NY Times reporter at a presidential press conference. Healthcare reform? Tax reform delayed longer than a reservation at The Polo Bar? Russian scandal? A floundering administration? Air strikes in Syria? Come on, be serious; the markets are impervious to the collection of such trivial matters, most of which, standing alone, would have felled a lesser foe. Stocks hold on to full valuations and bonds rally. It really is incredible when you think about it, and we all have. But we hang on for the ride, cognizant, perhaps even concerned, about that kryptonite event, but while the ride has had some mild bumps we all remain invested, sanguine in the belief that our capital is safe and sound.

Clearly, the one notable non-believer is Mario Draghi, he of the ECB, steadfast in his belief that the EU economy is not strong enough to exit QE. This is actually positive for the markets, although not for the banks. Free money to invest in an improving economy – what could be better? Maybe when the French elections are over he will get on board.

Here are 6 contrarian stock picks from Credit Suisse for the rest of the year

### TEXT: 
Credit Suisse's research team put out a note to clients Friday with its most differentiated, highest conviction stock recommendations.



"This report identifies companies where our analysts stand apart from the consensus view, companies where our analysis reveals opportunities that the market has not yet priced in," they wrote. "We screened our current US coverage universe to identify companies where our analysts' views diverged from that of the Street, focusing on rating, earnings projections as well as target price. To further strengthen the list of stocks, we worked closely with the research analysts to select stories in which our conviction level is high."



Smart fund managers like to avoid over-owned consensus stock ideas, because when sentiment shifts there may be more downside risk as investors flee for the exits at once. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Savita Subramanian has said it's more difficult for crowded stocks to move higher since everyone is already in the trade.



Here are the details on Credit Suisse's six outperform-rated "contrarian" stock picks and their 12-month price forecasts.

JPMorgan recommends Facebook and Netflix into earnings, but is 'cautious' on Amazon

### TEXT: 
One of Wall Street's top internet analysts, JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth, put out a note to clients Friday with his best stock ideas for the first-quarter earnings season.



The analyst cited how internet stocks under his coverage are up 10 percent this year versus the S&P 500's 5 percent return through Wednesday.



"We believe underlying trends in online advertising and eCommerce remain strong … Our favorite names remain FB and NFLX among large-caps and YELP and MTCH among smid-caps. As we think about the 1Q earnings setups, we are a bit more cautious on AMZN into print given the strong 14% rebound off mixed 4Q earnings & 1Q guide," he wrote. "AMZN will continue to gain meaningful share of overall eComm & retail—but we still think there is some near-term risk given significant share appreciation and many large-scale, concurrent investments across key areas," the note said.

STOCKS/ECONOMY

-Stock futures are a bit higher and have recovered sharply from steep losses last night when investors initially reacted negatively to the U.S. missile strikes on Syria. The markets now await this morning's March jobs report and any news from day two of the summit between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.

-The consensus estimate is that the economy added 180,000 net new jobs in March.

SYRIA ATTACK LATEST

-The Pentagon has released more details about the U.S. missile attack on Syria, describing its intentions to deter further chemical weapons attacks by Syria's President Bashar Assad on civilians. The U.S. did inform Russia of the attack beforehand, but the Kremlin says the action will do "serious damage" to the U.S.-Russian relationship. Syria says the U.S. has responded to a "false propaganda" campaign. And just hours before the attacks, Hillary Clinton called on the U.S. to launch air strikes against Syrian bases.

Breakingviews: Bezos’ deep pockets give him the edge over Musk in space race

### TEXT: 
Jeff Bezos' rocketing wealth fuels his space ambitions. The Amazon founder is selling $1 billion of stock a year to finance his dream of colonizing space. Both he and his company can afford it. The firm's dominance in cloud computing has added $25 billion to his worth in the past year. With a trajectory like that, the sky is not the limit.

Bezos' space company Blue Origin has similar ambitions and technology to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Both think reusing rockets, rather than letting them burn up on re-entry, will lower the price of space flight dramatically. Fuel costs, after all, represent only around 1 percent of the price of a launch. Both firms also hope tourism will bring in needed revenue. SpaceX wants to fly people around the moon next year, while Blue Origin plans to start by taking passengers on 11-minute weightless flights more than 60 miles up. The two billionaires both see such flights as the first step toward a future in which millions of people live and work off the Earth.

"We are in wait-and-see mode with regards to legislation on reducing regulation and greater economic growth that forces the Fed to increase interest rates more quickly."

AMD shares to plunge more than 20% because they are ‘priced for perfection,’ Goldman says

Investors should avoid Advanced Micro Devices shares because the company will suffer from competition from Nvidia and Intel this year, according to Goldman Sachs, which initiated coverage on the chipmaker with a sell rating.



AMD shares are up 25 percent this year and 406 percent in the past 12 months through Wednesday on anticipation of its new gaming graphics and processor chips.



While the company's "execution (i.e. new product launches, cost management and BS [balance sheet] deleveraging) has improved under CEO Lisa Su, we believe current risk-return is unfavorable," analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled "Priced for perfection."



"If AMD were to gain meaningful traction with its new products (e.g. Ryzen CPU, Naples CPU, Vega GPU) in 2017, we believe Intel and Nvidia would be likely to fight back in late-2017 and/or 2018 in the form of pricing concessions," he added.

### TITLE: 
Trump doesn't have to get tax reform perfect for these 9 stocks to see a rally, Jefferies says

### TEXT: 


After the Republican health-care reform effort failed, some investors are worried about the prospects for the rest of President Donald Trump's economic agenda. In fact, the S&P 500 turned lower during Wednesday trading in part because House Speaker Paul Ryan said tax reform may take longer than the Obamacare replacement effort.

But Jefferies told clients corporate tax reform has a large margin for error and there are companies that will still significantly benefit even if a smaller tax cut plan is implemented.



"Many point to the postelection rally as evidence that market expectations are high for tax reform, but certain data challenges that view. We detail 40 stocks that Jefferies analysts believe are likely to benefit from even a slimmed-down tax package. When all you're expecting is soggy bread with cheese, it's not that hard to be positively surprised," Jefferies' research team wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.



The analysts said the current Republican and Trump plans to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent or 20 percent from 35 percent will be difficult to pass due to controversy over the border adjusted tax.



"Still, the political importance of getting something done after the health-care failure is perhaps even higher; now is a unique time given Republican majorities, so there's still a good argument for some sort of reform," the report said.



As a result, Jefferies analysts looked for the companies that will benefit most from a more modest corporate tax rate reduction to 25 percent, the removal of some deductions and no border adjusted tax.



"Even a 25 percent rate would be a significant positive for many companies ... the market doesn't seem to be pricing in a high likelihood of successful reform," the note said.



Here are nine Jefferies buy-rated stocks that made the recommended list.

### TITLE: 
President Trump is not going to like what's behind this winning trade since the election

### TEXT: 
One of the best performing trades since the election of Donald Trump is an exchange-traded fund that capitalizes on the further destruction of the depleted manufacturing workforce that helped elect him.

In what has to be one of the more counterintuitive bets that have worked since the election, the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF is up 16 percent since the businessman spouting protectionist policies was swept into power, much better than the 10 percent return of the S&P 500 (returns through Tuesday's close).

So what gives?

Jack Ablin, the astute chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, notes the following in his latest outlook missive to clients:

"President Trump's pledge to bring America's jobs back home may carry an interesting side effect, the rise of robotics. A U.S. corporate tax rate cut, should it come to pass, would reduce the cost of doing business in the United States, but it would do nothing to curtail labor costs giving U.S. employers increased incentive to invest in labor-saving technology. Allowing accelerated depreciation on capital investments, as he's proposed, would only serve further push business leaders toward robots."



It makes sense. Trump strong-arms companies to keep factories open at home so they agree and get the friendly "Made in America" press coverage, but meanwhile they aggressively invest in automation to lower costs of operating the plant. United Technologies is basically doing that with the Carrier factory it was pressured to keep in Indiana by the president.

This automation boom is not a long-term thing either. Check out the expected surge in robot usage expected in the next two years:

Buy Under Armour because social media sentiment is improving, Jefferies says

Jefferies reiterated its buy rating on Under Armour, citing better social media data trends, which point to rising consumer brand sentiment.



Under Armour shares are down 34 percent this year through Tuesday, with most of the decline occurring after the company gave weaker-than-expected 2017 sales guidance on its Jan. 31 fourth-quarter earnings report. The shares are also down 55 percent in the previous 12 months.



"Our data analysis indicates a bottom forming in the social sphere for UA. The work shows the social share gains at Adidas in '16 have peaked and provides evidence that UA's sponsorship strategy is lifting brand heat," analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

Citigroup and Wells Fargo upgraded by KBW before earnings on rising rates

### TEXT: 
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods raised its ratings for Citigroup and Wells Fargo to outperform from market perform, saying the banks will benefit from increased shareholder capital return and Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Both banks report first-quarter earnings next week.



"We remain optimistic near term that bank fundamentals will continue improving — led mostly by higher rates. We expect regulatory changes to occur that will eventually benefit universal banks, but thus far we are only changing our expectations for capital return related to the annual Fed stress tests, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "Thus, our estimates reflect an improving rate environment and higher capital return, and that is enough for us to remain constructive on the space broadly."

### TITLE: 
This chart could hold the clue to the next big interest rate move

### TEXT: 
With the decline in interest rates perplexing to some, it may be time to look at the charts for guidance.

Since the Fed raised rates on March 15, the 10-year yield has done nothing but go down.

It fell from 2.62 percent March 14, to a low of 2.31 percent early Tuesday. The Fed clearly has more influence over short-end interest rates, but all rates might be expected to move higher across the curve, or at least hold steady, with the Fed in hiking mode.

Strategists say the 10-year has been trading in a range, with the potential to break higher — above 2.63 — if Washington makes progress on pro-growth policies, or very strong economic data. The 10-year could also dip below its current range, 2.30 percent, on signs of more gridlock in Congress or weaker economic reports.

"Construction machinery demand is in the early stages of recovery, with significant scope for inventory restock," analyst Jerry Revich wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "A modest construction recovery in key regions, compounded by normalization in machinery share of capex should drive strong demand growth off of historically low levels."

Citi downgrades Bank of America on valuation after its nearly 40% rally since election

Bank of America shares surged 39 percent since the Nov. 8 election through Monday versus the S&P 500's 10 percent return as investors anticipated President Donald Trump's pro-growth economic agenda.



"Since the election, BAC has outperformed and has substantially closed that gap with JPM. … We believe that the benefit of higher rates, the potential post-election improvement in regulatory and economic outlook are reflected in the current valuation," analyst Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to clients Monday. "We continue to believe the group is fully valued. So, we do not see a lot left to play for."

Sell high-flying chipmaker Nvidia because demand going ‘from bad to worse,’ analyst says

### TEXT: 
Pacific Crest lowered its rating on Nvidia to underweight from sector weight, saying a survey of the chipmaker's customers indicate earnings will come in below expectations this coming year.



"We are downgrading NVDA … due to signs of desktop GPU [graphics processing unit] market saturation, lower margins from incremental Nintendo Switch revenue and a possible pause in the company's datacenter business this summer," analyst Michael McConnell wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "Desktop graphics card manufacturers are noting material demand deceleration in sell-through since February."



Shares of Nvidia, which makes chips for the desktop graphics cards, are up 203 percent in the past 12 months through Monday on a successful launch of its new Pascal line of graphics chips. However, the stock is down 7 percent since the company's fourth-quarter earnings report Feb. 9.

Breakingviews: Apple proves once again it can be cold-blooded with suppliers

### TEXT: 
Apple has imagined away the future of one of its suppliers of chip know-how. Imagination Technologies lost more than 60 percent of its market value – a hit of over 450 million pounds – after the iPhone maker said it would stop using the UK firm's technology in 15 months to two years' time.

Imagination's intellectual property is used in graphics chips found in iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. The loss hits Imagination in two ways. The damage to its business is obvious. In the year to last April, fees and royalties from Apple totaled 61 million pounds. That's about half the British company's sales from continuing operations. Moreover, there are "minimal" direct costs associated with this revenue, according to the company, meaning pre-tax profit, estimated to approach 30 million pounds in the year to April 2018, could flip into a similarly sized loss.

These trades are too crowded and could be in for a big drop if things turn south, Credit Suisse says

### TEXT: 
A key, contrarian data point smart fund managers look at is how "crowded" a stock is in terms of institutional ownership. Credit Suisse steered clients away from a list of these most over-owned names in a report at the end of last week.



The firm aggregated all the positions from 1,350 actively managed funds, using Lipper, Morningstar and eVestment institutional ownership data. It then compared the position size versus the average weighting in actively managed funds to create its rankings.



The Credit Suisse "darlings of active managers" lists consist of the "most crowded names by size category, includes core, growth and value style funds, in terms of the number of funds that own the name," strategist Lori Calvasina wrote in the note clients Friday.

She added:

"We recommend against owning too many of these names due to: (1) less opportunity for differentiation, (2) underperformance over the life of our study and heightened risk of underperformance if news flow turns negative, and (3) ongoing outflows from actively managed funds as the shift into passive continues."

In similar fashion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Savita Subramanian has said it's more difficult for crowded stocks to move higher since everyone is already in the trade. When sentiment shifts there may be more downside risk as investors flee for the exits at once, she said.



Here are nine "most crowded" stocks over-owned by fund managers, according to Credit Suisse.

Netflix will miss its US subscriber guidance due to ‘lack of a blockbuster hit,’ analyst says

However, with expectations for a strong overall quarter already high, we'd still be cautious into Q1 results," analyst William Power wrote in a note to clients Monday. "Although Netflix released far more original programming than the prior year, the lack of a blockbuster hit may have contributed to this quarter's soft survey results."

"We are downgrading UAA … given recent checks, proprietary surveys, unfavorable trends, and our apparel/footwear analysis pointing to continued sales/margin pressure. Our checks show a price war is intensifying between NKE and UA," analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a note to clients Monday.

Under Armour shares are down 32 percent year to date through Friday, with most of the decline occurring after the company gave weaker-than-expected 2017 sales guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 31.

Full interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Trump, computer trading and the economy

### TEXT: 
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his views on the markets and President Donald Trump's agenda in an exclusive interview Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box."



On the importance of Trump's agenda: "If we don't have tax reform that we're expecting, if we don't see true deregulation, I think the markets would have some setbacks," he said. "You're seeing a slowing down of our economy into the first quarter, we're going to grow probably less than 1.5 percent. Much of it is people are just waiting to see … what's going to happen with tax reform and deregulation."



On the economy: "You have high confidence in America, but you're not seeing that translated into sales. We're seeing car sales slow down. We're seeing a beginning of some factory orders slowing down. We're not seeing that ramp up that everybody was expecting," Fink said. "It's not happening. A lot of it is the uncertainty in Washington."



Fink is a member of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. BlackRock is the world's largest investment management firm, with $5.1 trillion in assets and operations in more than 30 countries.



He also discussed:

His firm's increased usage of computer investing

Full interview with Leon Cooperman on Fed, Trump and his stock picks

Leon Cooperman, chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, shared his market views in an interview Wednesday on CNBC's "Halftime Report."

On Federal Reserve policy: "I'm firmly of the belief, rightly or wrongly, that you're going to have capital losses in bonds over the next couple of years. It's going to unfold very slowly because the Fed is very reluctant to move. They're reluctant to move in part because of the problems of income disparity in the economy," Cooperman said.

"I think the Fed's monetary policy is designed to get more people to work to reduce the income disparity and reduce social stress, and I think there's an element of correctness in that."

On the stock market: "I think the market is reasonably fully valued. I don't think it's euphorically priced in any way," he said. "So I would say the conditions for a big decline are not present."

Before founding the hedge fund Omega Advisors in 1991, Cooperman was chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

David Einhorn on his proposal to boost General Motors, how to trade Trump’s agenda

### TEXT: 
Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn shared his market views in an exclusive interview on CNBC's "Halftime Report" Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the hedge fund manager proposed a dual share class structure for General Motors aimed at increasing shareholder value.



On his General Motors plan: "Some investors just want … the dividend. They don't care about the other 75 percent of the earnings. And there's other investors that care about the earnings, but don't care about the dividend," he said. "Our idea is essentially to pay the same money to the same people. Just do it in two different CUSIPs. That way everybody can have what they want. … If you actually implemented this plan, which we expect that they will, you're going to unlock a tremendous amount of value."



On trading President Donald Trump's agenda: "You're going to have a lot of jobs. You're going to have higher wages because you're going to have maybe a labor shortage. Plus you're going to have higher interest income because the Fed is raising interest rates. All of this is very positive for personal income," Einhorn said. "If you have high levels of personal income, I think you're going to wind up with high levels of demand for new cars. … Investors are very focused on things like infrastructure stocks, when really I think that if you believe the Trump story, you should be investing in consumer durables like autos."

Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital was up 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year, bringing its performance for 2016 to 8.4 percent compared to the S&P 500's 12 percent return, according to an investor letter. From inception in May 1996 to the end of 2016, the fund generated annual net returns of 16.1 percent.

Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas sees Tesla eventually launching a sharing model

### TEXT: 
Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas shared his views on Tesla in an interview Monday on CNBC's "Power Lunch."

On Tesla's future: "We think that Tesla is morphing into more of a transportation company using vehicle machines sold today as a funding strategy to become something much much bigger, not tapping into hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, but more billions, hundreds of billions of miles," Jonas said. Then "launching a transportation as a service."

On what's next for electric cars: "Well, we think the electric cars for private use really are ... for human driving pleasure for wealthier individuals," he said. "That's why it's so important that in the shared model where you're not driving 10,000 miles a year, but 50 or 100 in a fleet operation, then the economics of electrification you can get that pay back period under three years. That's the game changer — shared."

Jonas is the head of global auto research at Morgan Stanley. He is known for his detailed coverage of automotive stocks.

The analyst also discusses his prediction for used car values in the coming years.

Full interview with Blackstone's Byron Wien on why the market dipped, Trump

### TEXT: 
Blackstone's Byron Wien shared his thoughts on President Donald Trump's administration and the recent market decline in an interview Wednesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."

On the market: "My view is that the market was due for a correction. The market had gone up almost every day since the election. ... And it was based on Trump being able to implement his pro-growth agenda. ... He said he could get growth from 2 percent, where it's been since the recession ended, to 4 percent. It now looks like he won't get to 3 percent. And 3 percent was what the market was counting on. And so, that's why the market is correcting. It's correcting because maybe Trump won't be as successful in implementing legislation as he promised," Wien said.

On whether the narrative he predicted for Trump in his surprises list is happening: "I would say it's not happening, but it will happen. I'm saying that it's on-the-job training for Donald Trump, and he's learning that he wasn't elected king, he was elected president, and he has to work with Congress to get his program through," Wien said.

On health care: "I definitely think that focusing on the Affordable Care Act first was a mistake. Obama made the same mistake. He focused on health care, and he should have been focusing on job creation after the recession of 2008-09," he added. "Trump should have focused on his economic program and put the Affordable Care Act on the back burner, but maybe circumstances dictated that he couldn't set the priorities that way. I definitely think it was a mistake, but it's been made, and now he has to deal with it."

Wien, a 50-year veteran of Wall Street, is vice chairman of multi-asset investing at Blackstone. Previously, he was chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. His annual 10 surprises prediction list is considered required reading by many on the Street.

He also discusses:



Deregulation

Because of Warren Buffett, people now realize Apple does have a 'moat,' analyst says

### TEXT: 
UBS analyst Steven Milunovich shared his views on Apple in an interview Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."



On Apple's run in the market: "The December quarter was pretty solid. The guidance wasn't as poor as people expected. The supply chain is starting to think about ramping up for the new iPhone 8. So I think investor confidence is just increasing. Now, we're going to see a strong iPhone 8 cycle, and then of course, you have Warren Buffett buying in, which suggests that maybe there are more moats around Apple than investors have given it credit for."

On the cyclical nature of Apple's stock: "Increasingly, we're thinking you could have a two-year cycle here, particularly depending upon supply of OLED. And investors want to see more consistency. The company has been emphasizing services, but really we should go up a level to look at the installed base of iPhones, which is still growing close to 20 percent, and the retention rate, which is 90 percent. As long as those things are in place, you've got a fairly consistent story here, and then hopefully, longer-term optionality with some major new products coming."

On Apple in China: "China is critical to Apple. It used to be two-thirds of growth and now it's actually a drag. And how the iPhone 8 does next year depends to a large degree on how China does. We do think the issues that Apple has had in China are more cyclical than secular."

Milunovich is the managing director at UBS, known for his coverage of technology stocks and detailed analysis of Apple.

Apple announced on Tuesday new versions of its 9.7-inch iPad and iPhone 7.

He also discusses:

Brave Warrior's Glenn Greenberg reveals his big market bet right now in rare interview

### TEXT: 
Glenn Greenberg of Brave Warrior Advisors, a value investor known for his concentrated bets, said he is long financial shares including JPMorgan, Primerica and Charles Schwab in a rare interview with CNBC's Kelly Evans.

"We made a big bet that normal interest rates would not stay at zero," said Greenberg. "It was that simple. And we didn't know when they would change, but the payoff we felt would be substantial so we have had a lot of financial stocks in our portfolio the last couple years."

Greenberg started Brave Warrior in 2009 near the start of the bull market after more than two decades at Chieftain Capital Management. Greenberg said he owns only about 10 stocks in his portfolio right now.

The investor made clear he is a stock picker and he is not sure how the overall economic picture will play out, but it is more likely than not that rates go higher and the economy ramps up from here.

"Rates could go a lot higher. Inflation could go a lot higher," he said.

On JPMorgan specifically, Greenberg said, "They should be earning $8 or $9 in a couple years if rates track at the moderate increases that are in the [Federal Reserve's] dot plot."

Other topics in this special "Value Spark" interview include:

Four things he looks for in a stock

Other holdings: Airbus, Express Scripts

David Tepper on Trump's deregulation unleashing 'animal spirits,' shorting bonds, favorite stock ideas

### TEXT: 
Billionaire investor David Tepper of Appaloosa Management shared his market views in an exclusive interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" Wednesday.

On the market: "On a multiple basis it's kind of full ... I don't think the market's cheap," Tepper said. "On the other hand, with that backdrop of growth around the world, with the potential we'll do other things here, with the sugar that's still being put on by the ECB, BOJ and let's face it the Fed is way low ... you can't be short in that kind of setup."

On deregulation: "The day that we had three Republican houses, the President, the two houses, that was the day there wasn't going to be another regulation put on the economy. And that alone just releases animal spirits," he said. It "upticks earnings."

On shorting bonds: "If we're short US bonds, we're betting on a stronger economy here. That's the bet," he said. "Listen bonds are really hard to own. The yields are really low."

On Federal Reserve policy: "I personally think the Fed will raise more quickly and for sure I'll bet, if you do get some of this stimulus they'll have to raise more quickly," he said. "And then it's a probability if you believe they'll get this stuff through or not get this stuff through."

From inception in 1993 through 2015, Tepper's main fund generated annual returns of 25 percent compared to the S&P 500 at 9.5 percent, according to market sources. Appaloosa Management has $17 billion of assets under management.

Acampora: Market due for a sideways pause that unwinds 'excess of the last couple of weeks'

### TEXT: 
The stock market is likely to trade in a narrow range from here given the strong gains over the past four months, but it will eventually move higher, according to Ralph Acampora, director of tactical research at Altaira Capital Partners.



"I think it could be something like we just saw in December, January and February. It could be a very tight trading range — 2 or 3 percent — unwind the excess of the last couple of weeks and move on higher," the widely followed technical analyst said.

"I don't have much technical evidence to suggest much worse than that, at least not now," he added.

In this conversation, Acampora is joined by Mike Allison, portfolio manager and director of equity strategy at Eaton Vance Management, who weighs in on what's next for the market.



"As the Fed begins to tighten, we tend to see a rotation from the so-called bond proxies or high dividend yielding equities into equities that exhibit more dividend growth," Allison said.



CNBC's senior market commentator, Michael Santoli, also chimes in along with CNBC's Kelly Evans.

On President Donald Trump: "I am optimistic with this administration. … I think this administration is solution oriented," Bresch said. Health care "is a huge problem, as he said it's complicated, so it's going to have to take bold action to be able to really look at this holistically."

Gene Munster says Snap will be 'more like Twitter than Facebook'

### TEXT: 
Venture capitalist Gene Munster spoke with CNBC about the upcoming Snap IPO, and whether it could be a viable investment.



Snap Inc., owner of the messaging application Snapchat, will price its initial public offering after the close on Wednesday, potentially commanding a valuation of as much as $25 billion.



"I think the next year is going to be challenging because probably this is going to feel more like Twitter than Facebook," said Munster, in reference to the volatility around Twitter shares since the microblogging company went public in 2013.



During its filing with the SEC in February, Snap admitted it may never achieve profitability.



Munster says the hype around the stock, however, has pushed valuations to levels that may not be sustainable. Snap is valued at 30 times next year's revenue compared with Facebook, which was valued at 19 times back on its IPO in 2012, according to Munster's estimates.



"This is an expensive stock, so I think it's going to be choppy for the next year," he emphasized.



Munster co-founded Loup Ventures in January. Previously, he was a prominent Piper Jaffray technology analyst for 21 years and known for his in-depth coverage of Apple.



In this conversation, Munster is joined by Jason Calacanis, founder and CEO of Inside.com, who also weighs in on where Snap could be headed.

### summary: 
Venture capitalist Gene Munster spoke with CNBC about the upcoming Snap IPO, and whether it could be a viable investment.
"I think the next year is going to be challenging because probably this is going to feel more like Twitter than Facebook," said Munster, in reference to the volatility around Twitter shares since the microblogging company went public in 2013.

Target CEO Brian Cornell on why border tax could cause prices to jump 20 to 25 percent

### TEXT: 
Target CEO Brian Cornell spoke with CNBC about his plans to stem the retailer's slump in sales, and how potential tax changes under the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress could impact his company.

"I think this is across the entire industry — not just Target — but as this plan is structured we can see consumer prices go up 20 or 25 percent," Cornell said in reference to the border adjustment tax in House Speaker Paul Ryan's reform proposal. It is not yet clear whether President Donald Trump will endorse that part of the plan, but he may give a hint Tuesday evening in his speech to Congress.

"That's not good for anyone in America, and it's certainly not good for the families that shop at our stores," Cornell added.

Shares of Target fell more than 12 percent Tuesday, their largest one-day loss in eight years as the retailer reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that were lower than expected.



In this conversation with CNBC's Courtney Reagan, the executive lays out his long-term strategy to turn around the company. Only PRO members have access to this full interview.

Top analyst explains how to profitably trade Apple, why Buffett owns it

### TEXT: 
Sanford C. Bernstein technology analyst Toni Sacconaghi shared his views on Apple in an interview Tuesday on CNBC's "Halftime Report."



On how to trade Apple: "Our analysis suggests that the stock is highly anticipatory of new product announcements," Sacconaghi said. "We found that the stock appreciates [and] outperforms the market by an average of 1,600 basis points in the six months prior to an iPhone product launch."



On why Warren Buffett owns the iPhone maker: "He loves great consumer franchises, which obviously Apple has. He loves recurring revenue. He likes disciplined capital deployment," Sacconaghi said. "Apple fits the bill on all of those things."



Sacconaghi's picks have a 21.5 percent one-year average return with a 70 percent success rate, according to analyst ranking service TipRanks, placing him in the top 3 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.

Jeremy Siegel says Dow is headed toward 22,000

### TEXT: 
Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School, says the Dow could be headed toward 22,000 given the pro-growth economic policies expected under the Trump administration.

"I think 22,000 is what's justified if we get the Republican part of the Trump agenda and that is lower corporate taxes and lower regulation," Siegel said. "My feeling is that should give you 20 percent altogether — we've had 10 percent since he's been elected," he added.

The new target by Siegel, who had been calling for Dow 20,000 since 2014, implies a gain of about 6 percent from where the benchmark closed Monday.

In this exclusive interview, Siegel is joined by Dennis Berman, business editor at The Wall Street Journal, who discusses what could be ahead for the market.

India extends $4.5 billion line of credit to Bangladesh

### TEXT: 
NEW DELHI (AP) — India and Bangladesh signed a slew of agreements on Saturday, including a $4.5 billion concessionary line of credit from India for development projects in Bangladesh, as the South Asian neighbors try to deepen their ties.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, held wide-ranging talks in New Delhi, exchanging views on defense, regional security and cooperation in combating international terrorism.

Officials from the two sides signed 22 agreements, including a framework deal for defense cooperation over the next five years and an additional $500 million for Bangladesh to buy military equipment from India.

The two sides also signed an agreement on civil nuclear cooperation under which India will help Bangladesh develop its civilian nuclear program.

Modi said Hasina's visit marked the "golden era" of India-Bangladesh relations and described India as "a long-standing and trusted development partner of Bangladesh."

India and Bangladesh share a nearly 4,100-kilometer (2,545-mile) border. The two countries have had a close relationship since 1971, when Bangladesh, aided by India, gained independence from Pakistan following a bloody nine-month war.

RPT-ANALYSIS-With Australian supply disrupted, coking coal buyers race to secure needs

### TEXT: 
secure needs@ (Repeats April 6 story with no changes in text)

MANILA, April 6 (Reuters) - A powerful cyclone in Australia has put supply of coking coal at risk, forcing big buyers like China and Japan to scour the world for alternative supplies and fueling a rally in prices as the world's top exporter braces for lost business.

Russia, Mongolia, Mozambique and the United States would benefit from Australia's disrupted supply as steel producers from China and Japan to India and Turkey move quickly to replace Australian cargoes.

"Cyclone Debbie has not only impacted China, but also Indian steel mills which were running low on stocks, and also Japan and Turkey," said a shipping source who tracks global coal cargoes but who declined to be named because the deals are private.

"So it looks like a perfect storm for coking coal prices, unless rail lines in Australia get back to work sooner than expected."

Landslides caused by Debbie have halted operations on the busiest rail line connecting coking coal mines in Australia's Queensland state to ports, and rail operator Aurizon said it would take about five weeks to repair.

BHP Billiton , the world's biggest shipper of coking coal, said it won't meet its export commitments from its mines in Queensland's Bowen Basin - among five miners in the region to declare force majeure, a clause typically invoked after natural disasters.

India's Jindal Steel and Power, which runs a coking coal mine in Australia's New South Wales, also declared force majeure, with mining operations halted by nonstop rains.

The prospect of a five-week delay until the rail lines are repaired, followed by the time needed to restore coal flows from mines to port and then a roughly 12-14 day journey to ports in China and Japan means coking coal consumers may struggle to avoid running out of supplies before normal service from Australia is resumed.

Steel plants use coking, or metallurgical, coal to fire blast furnaces. A shortfall in the commodity means they will have to either close down production, impacting steel output, or risk damaging the furnaces.

About 13 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia will be affected due to the disruption, or about 3 percent of global coking coal supply this year, said Daniel Hynes, commodity strategist at ANZ.

Queensland accounts for 60 percent of Australia's coal exports, which reached a record 221 million tonnes last year. Some 75 percent of Queensland's coal is coking coal and the rest is thermal, used in power plants.

Australian premium coking coal futures in Singapore have surged 43 percent to $225 a tonne in two days while Chinese futures jumped 9 percent to a four-month high on Wednesday.

CHINA'S PLANS

China is the world's biggest producer of steel and buys nearly half of its coking coal imports from Australia, and will have to move swiftly to avoid disruptions.

"We plan to buy more coking coal from Russia and Mongolia," said an official in charge of raw materials at a Chinese mill that imports about 5 million tonnes of coking coal annually, mainly from Australia.

"Coking coal from Russia and Mongolia is very important for us. We seldom use U.S. (coking coal) but maybe in the future we'll use more from the U.S."

Coal traders have said Chinese buyers are also looking to fix cargoes from the United States.

Stockpiles of imported coal at seven main Chinese ports stood at 15.5 million tonnes as of March 31, according to SteelHome consultancy. The inventory includes both coking coal and thermal coal.

China imported 59 million tonnes of coking coal last year, just over a third of its annual consumption, which ANZ estimates at 170 million tonnes.

There should be sufficient capacity from coking coal suppliers like Russia, Canada and the United States to meet short-term demand, said Wang Di from CRU consultancy.

'DESPERATE BUYERS'

China "has to seek alternative supplies in unison with drawing down on that inventory (of coking coal)," said ANZ's Hynes.

"It will definitely result in some desperate buyers over the course of April."

Apart from seeking supplies overseas, some Chinese steel mills may boost use of local coal, which should benefit Shanxi Coking Coal Group Co Ltd, the biggest supplier.

"We buy some Australian cargoes sometimes. But we mostly buy locally, and the quality is good for our requirement," said an official at a southern Chinese mill that produces 10 million tonnes of steel a year.

In Japan, where coking coal imports have dropped in the past two months, No.2 steelmaker JFE Holdings said it expects to secure supply for the next four to five weeks from its inventories and some adjustment in shipments. Outside Australia, JFE buys coking coal from Russia and Canada.

Japan is the world's No. 2 steel producer and Australia supplies half of its coking coal needs.

Steel mills in India, also a major importer of coking coal, could also face problems.

"Whoever has stocks to manage over a short period of time they will be okay, but those who are living on a day to day (basis) will have serious problems," Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at India's biggest steel producer, JSW Steel , told Reuters.

In Japan, where coking coal imports have dropped in the past two months, No.2 steelmaker JFE Holdings said it expects to secure supply for the next four to five weeks from its inventories and some adjustment in shipments. Outside Australia, JFE buys coking coal from Russia and Canada.

Japan is the world's No. 2 steel producer and Australia supplies half of its coking coal needs.

Steel mills in India, also a major importer of coking coal, could also face problems.

"Whoever has stocks to manage over a short period of time they will be okay, but those who are living on a day to day (basis) will have serious problems," Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at India's biggest steel producer, JSW Steel , told Reuters.

### summary: 
About 13 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia will be affected due to the disruption, or about 3 percent of global coking coal supply this year, said Daniel Hynes, commodity strategist at ANZ.
Some 75 percent of Queensland's coal is coking coal and the rest is thermal, used in power plants.
The inventory includes both coking coal and thermal coal.
China imported 59 million tonnes of coking coal last year, just over a third of its annual consumption, which ANZ estimates at 170 million tonnes.

UPDATE 3-India c.bank moves to cut system's excess cash to help contain inflation

### TEXT: 
inflation@

* Repo rate left at 6.25 pct for 3rd meeting in a row

* Raises reverse repo rate to narrow yields in money markets

* RBI says decision consistent with "neutral" policy stance

* Bond yields rise, shares erase loss on RBI decision (Updates with quotes, details)

MUMBAI, April 6 (Reuters) - India's central bank surprised markets on Thursday by raising a secondary rate while holding the key rate steady, a move to help mop up liquidity and signal its worries about a potential spike in inflation.

As widely expected, the Reserve Bank of India kept the repo rate at 6.25 percent, where it's been since October. But it raised the reverse repo rate - what banks get for deposits at the RBI - by 25 basis points to 6.00 percent.

Narrowing the gap between those two rates reduces volatility in short-term money market rates which track the difference between them.

Importantly, it also encourages banks to increase their deposits at the RBI, setting up the RBI to start withdrawing some of the big cash pile accumulated in the banking system since Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November banned circulation of big currency-notes.

"With inflation set to accelerate further, we think that hikes to the repo rate will come onto the agenda much sooner than is generally anticipated," said Capital Economics.

For sure, inflation is central to future monetary policy.

"Although we expect the RBI to remain on hold for some time, if domestic food prices increase on weak monsoons and/or oil prices spike up, we would expect the RBI to hike the repo rate to manage inflationary expectations," Quantum Debt Fund told clients.

MULTIPLE SURPRISES

Although Thursday's repo decision had been widely expected, the hike in the reverse repo marked a surprise, continuing a pattern of unexpected decisions at RBI meetings since Urjit Patel became governor in September.

In February, the central bank unexpectedly held the key rate, instead of cutting, and changed its policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," reasserting its concerns about inflation.

India's benchmark 10-year bond yield spiked 12 basis points, its biggest single-day rise since mid-November 2016, after the RBI held rates and signaled the cash draining moves.

Meanwhile the rupee strengthened to 64.52, its strongest level against the dollar in 20 months, from its 64.88 close after the RBI held rates, in line with other Asian central banks this month that have opted to do the same.

India's consumer inflation climbed to 3.65 percent in February from a year earlier, from its lowest levels in at least five years.

INFLATION PROJECTIONS

On Thursday, the RBI slightly raised its inflation projections for the year started in April, saying it expected the consumer price index to average 4.5 percent in the first half, from its previous forecast 4.0 to 4.5 percent, and then 5.0 percent in the second half, up from 4.5 to 5.0 percent.

That would place inflation above the RBI's 4 percent target.

"The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner," the RBI said.

The central bank is concerned that food prices could spike should India experience a below-average monsoon season this year. It is also monitoring core inflation, which has stubbornly stayed around 5 percent for several months.

As part of tackling inflation, the RBI pledged steps to drain liquidity, given cash in the banking system has soared to around 4 trillion rupees ($61.59 billion), doubling from January.

The RBI said it would consider measures such as additional treasury bill sales, outright open market operations bond sales, or a special facility that would allow the RBI to soak up the liquidity without collateral.

The central bank said it is "committed to reverting system liquidity to a position closer to neutrality, consistent with the stance of monetary policy."

SocGen, BNP woo funds eyeing India with tax saving gambit -sources

### TEXT: 
* SocGen, BNP pitch France as investment source for India

* Say France, India have advantageous tax treaty

* Pitches involve investing via special products, P-notes

* SocGen, BNP say in full compliance with local rules

MUMBAI, April 6 (Reuters) - Societe Generale and BNP Paribas are wooing hedge funds to invest in India through France, noting a special treaty between the two countries that allows investors to avoid paying tax in one of the world's hottest emerging markets.

The banks point out to investors that routing investments through their Paris base, where they have existing structures in place, would cushion them against the impact of a sweeping revamp in Indian tax rules - the General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) - which came into effect this month, six people with knowledge of the banks' communications told Reuters.

Those people noted that investing in India via France, while legal, could prove controversial with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is targeting foreign investments that avoid Indian taxes by coming through countries with special tax treaties.

Also, the two French banks are promoting investments into so-called participatory notes, or P-notes - products created by banks to track Indian shares, debt and derivatives - the people said.

A government-appointed panel warned in 2015 that P-notes could lead to "misuse", including money laundering or the channelling into domestic markets of unaccounted wealth held by Indians abroad.

In response to Reuters queries, Societe Generale said it is "fully committed to preventing tax fraud and evasion."

"We comply with local regulations in countries where we operate. This includes SEBI's regulation on the distribution of Indian P-Notes to eligible investors," it added, referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

A spokeswoman for BNP Paribas said: "We deny the assertion that we have promoted investment via France as a way to avoid CGT (capital gains tax)."

"BNP Paribas complies with all ODI (offshore derivative instruments) regulations as issued by SEBI and the applicable tax rules including GAAR... Our global set-up to provide market access products has remained consistent in all countries where we operate, including in India, and has not changed in response to the recent amendments to Indian regulations."

A spokesman for India's finance ministry declined to comment.

ADVISING CAUTION

Amit Maheshwari, a senior tax consultant, said he had been approached by clients who were contacted by the two French banks, but had advised caution.

"P-notes will definitely be a big concern because the government doesn't want to promote them," he said, adding also that the government would likely be concerned if funds were steering investments via France.

"The Indian government now wants their fair share of taxes, and this is something which will create ripples with the tax authorities," Maheshwari said, adding he expected New Delhi would push for a renegotiation of its tax treaty with France.

The treaty was one of several India signed in the 1980s and 1990s when it sought to attract overseas capital. It has similar double taxation avoidance deals with countries such as The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.

The banks say "there is no way the Indian government can challenge us under GAAR, so why don't you use our route? You will not pay any tax," said another senior official at a tax and consulting firm who said he was approached by clients who received emails from BNP and Societe Generale.

Reuters could not independently verify the content of the banks' emails to potential clients. Other tax consultants, a hedge fund and a banker spoke to Reuters on the issue on condition they were not identified.

FRANCE IN SPOTLIGHT

Under Modi, India has begun amending tax treaties with other countries in an attempt to clamp down on what it sees as abuse of its domestic tax rules.

It has already amended treaties with Singapore and Mauritius, which together account for around a third of foreign direct investment into India, including portfolio investments.

Those agreements phase in higher CGT over two years, rising to the full 15 percent tax rate India imposes on short-term capital gains on shares and 30 percent on futures and options. Investments held longer than 12 months are not taxed.

That makes France, ranked only ninth among the sources of foreign capital coming to India in April-December last year, a relatively attractive investment route - as investors would not have to pay any short-term CGT in India as long as the investment held is less than 10 percent of a company's share capital.

India is attracting foreign investment on hopes for an improving economy and more reforms. Its NSE share index is up more than 13 percent this year to a record high and the rupee currency is at a near-1-year high.

Investing in India via France carries the risk that India could at any time seek to amend the tax treaty. And New Delhi has some leverage given France is keen to boost defence sales to India, such as its Rafale fighter jets.

UPDATE 2-India c.bank keeps policy rate on hold, keen to drain system's excess cash

excess cash@

* Repo rate left at 6.25 pct for 3rd meeting in a row

* Raises reverse repo rate to narrow yields in money markets

* RBI says decision consistent with "neutral" policy stance

* Bond yields rise, shares gain on RBI decision (Updates with quotes, detail)

MUMBAI, April 6 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.25 percent for a third consecutive policy meeting on Thursday as it continues to guard against any

potential flare-up in inflation. .

The RBI also announced a 25 basis point rise in the reverse repo rate to 6.00 percent, narrowing the gap between the repo and the reverse repo. That reduces volatility in short-term money market rates which track the difference between those two rates, as well as encourage banks to park their funds with RBI.

The narrowing of the corridor between the two rates is intended to stabilise money markets, and sets up the RBI to start withdrawing some of the big pile of cash that has accumulated in the banking system since last year.

All 60 economists polled by Reuters had predicted the RBI's monetary policy committee would keep the repo rate at 6.25 percent, where it's been since October.

The MPC's vote was 6-0, just like the previous meetings, as the panel continues to exhibit a united front in its objective of keeping inflation at around 4 percent, with elbow room of 2 percentage points at either side.

The RBI, which unexpectedly changed its policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative" at its last review in February, reasserted its concerns about inflation. This comes in spite of calls for the RBI to do more to aid an economy growing at less than the 8 percent needed to create full employment.

"The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner," the RBI said in a statement.

"Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored."

CONCERN ON FOOD PRICES

India's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 5 basis points to 6.74 percent after the decision, but the rupee strengthened to 64.84 from around 64.94 after the RBI kept rates on hold. The broader NSE share index erased an earlier loss of 0.3 percent.

The consumer inflation rate climbed to 3.65 percent in February from a year earlier, picking up from its lowest levels in at least five years.

The RBI is concerned that food prices could spike should India experience a below-average monsoon season this year. It is also monitoring core inflation, which has stubbornly stayed around 5 percent for several months.

As part of tackling inflation, the RBI pledged it would take steps to drain liquidity given cash in the banking system has soared to around 4 trillion rupees ($61.59 billion), doubling from January.

The surge came come after the government last year removed higher-value bank notes from circulation, leading to huge deposits of the banned bills.

In a separate document, the RBI said it would undertake measures such as additional treasury bill sales, outright open market operations bond sales, or a special facility that would allow the RBI to soak up the liquidity without collateral.

The RBI said it is "committed to reverting system liquidity to a position closer to neutrality, consistent with the stance of monetary policy."

Twitter ‘Lite’ launches as company hunts for growth in emerging markets

### TEXT: 
Twitter launched a less data-intensive version of its service for the emerging markets on Thursday where internet connections can be patchy, in a bid to tap into a new user base as the social media firm struggles for growth.

The service is called Twitter Lite and can only be accessed via a mobile web browser like Google Chrome and takes up less than 1 megabyte on your device. The company said it optimized it for speed to give it a 30 percent faster launch time than the standard app and quicker navigation.

Users will be able to get key Twitter features including the timeline, tweets, direct messages, profiles, media uploads and notifications. Using Google Chrome, users can also get push notifications like with the app and an icon can be added to the home screen to launch Twitter Lite quickly.

There is also a data saver mode which allows a user to preview images and videos before choosing to fully download them, with the aim of reducing data usage.

Twitter has been struggling to grow its user base and monetize its platform, but success in the emerging markets could unlock a massive user base.

By 2020, there will be 5.7 billion smartphone connections, up from 3.8 billion at the end of last year, according to mobile industry body GSMA. Developing markets will account for nine out of 10 new mobile subscribers in the years up to 2020, GSMA said, with India and China set to drive the growth. While 4G technology is set to rise over the next few years, there will still be many countries and regions where slower 2G and 3G connections dominate. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 88 percent of mobile connections are expected to be either 2G or 3G, while in the Middle East and North Africa region, this number is around 82 percent, GSMA forecasts show.

India LNG demand to dip on phase out of subsidy for power sector

### TEXT: 
CHIBA, Japan, April 5 (Reuters) - India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand could ease as the government has scrapped subsidies on gas sales to power companies, the chief executive of the country's biggest gas importer said on Wednesday at a gas conference in Japan.

Natural gas accounts for about 6.5 percent of India's overall energy needs, far lower than the global average. India plans to raise the share of gas in its energy mix to 15 percent over the next three years, but a major challenge to that goal is the price sensitivity of Indian consumers.

India has for the last two fiscal years been giving discounts on the sale of imported LNG to revive more than 14 gigawatts of stranded power generation capacity that had been hit by domestic gas shortages.

But a power ministry official confirmed that the LNG subsidy has not been extended beyond March 31, and Prabhat Singh, chief executive of Petronet LNG, said these gas-based projects cannot compete with plants using cheaper coal.

"If (the power subsidies in India) don't happen, then definitely around a million to 2 million tonnes of LNG which was going there will be lost," Singh told reporters at Gastech in Japan.

After the subsidies were first put in place, India's annual LNG imports surged 15 percent to 16.08 million tonnes in 2015/16. Then for the first 11 months of the 2016/2017 fiscal year - the April-February period - India imported 17 million tonnes. Data for March is not yet available.

Iran "not concerned" by Indian threat to cut oil imports

### TEXT: 
LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Iran's oil minister dismissed India's decision to cut oil imports from Tehran in 2017/18 by a fifth as a threat on Wednesday, in an escalation of a dispute over a giant gas field contract.

Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Indian state refiners were going to cut oil imports from Iran, as New Delhi seeks to put pressure on Tehran to award the Farzad B gas field to an Indian consortium.

"India is one of our good costumers, but we cannot sign (a) contract under threat," Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Iran's ISNA news agency.

"India's cut of oil imports from Iran will not cause any trouble to us as we have other buyers," he added.

Zanganeh said despite an extension of deadlines, India has not offered an acceptable proposal for the development of the gas field.

"Their proposal was not profitable to Iran ... We sent (the) Indians a letter and told them we are keen to continue negotiations, but under sensible conditions, not under threats."

India, Iran's biggest oil buyer after China, was among a handful of countries that continued to deal with the Tehran despite Western sanctions over its nuclear program.

A consortium headed by ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of Indian explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, discovered Farzad B in the Farsi offshore block in 2008.

The consortium, which also includes Oil India and Indian Oil Corp, could not obtain permission to develop the field due to Western sanctions, but those sanctions were removed last year.

India and Iran had both been hopeful of wrapping up the Farzad B deal by March, although Zanganeh said Iran has asked other countries to submit their proposals for its development. (Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; editing by Alexander Smith)

(Adds oil settlement prices)

* Brent, U.S. crude at highest since March 8

* Wall St cuts losses as Trump talks deregulation, infrastructure

* Trump-Xi meeting is top-of-mind for traders

* Energy shares move up as oil prices jump

NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to a near one-month high on Tuesday on expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories, while the dollar slid as investors remained cautious ahead of meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The upcoming French presidential election also kept investors cautious as political risk concerns remained active ahead of the Trump-Xi meetings this Thursday and Friday.

U.S. stocks traded little changed, following modest gains in Europe, with the energy and industrials sectors helping buoy Wall Street and European shares.

Global and U.S. crude oil benchmarks rose to their highest since March 8. They have recovered 8 percent since lows late last month on expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers would cut output.

"OPEC compliance is still holding better than we expected with next week's release of various monthly agency reports likely to confirm," Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.

U.S. crude rose 79 cents to settle up at $51.03 per barrel and Brent settled up $1.05 to $54.17.

The American Petroleum Institute will report inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Tuesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration will announce official figures on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT. The dollar index rose 0.04 percent, with the euro down 0.05 percent to $1.0663. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 110.73 per dollar.

Industrial and material stocks got a boost after Trump said the U.S. infrastructure bill may top $1 trillion and that his administration was seeking a major "haircut" on the Dodd-Frank banking regulation, rekindling some of his campaign promises.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.93 points, or 0.14 percent, to 20,679.14. The S&P 500 lost 0.11 points, or -0.00 percent, to 2,358.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.36 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,893.32.

In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent to close at 1,497.77 while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.01 percent.

Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields touched their lowest in more than five weeks before edging higher to trade little changed on doubts about Trump's ability to boost fiscal stimulus.

Yields on benchmark 10-year notes dropped to 2.314 percent, their lowest since Feb. 24, and last traded up 1/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent.

South Africa's rand and government bonds recovered after a sharp selloff following S&P Global Ratings' decision to cut the country's credit rating to sub-investment grade, while stocks rose led by bullion shares.

The rand was 1.06 percent stronger at 13.5250 per dollar after falling earlier in the session to a near 3-months low of 13.9400.

(Updates prices, changes comment, dateline from previous LONDON)

* Wall St cuts losses as Trump talks deregulation, infrastructure

* Trump-Xi meeting is top-of-mind for traders

NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after forecasts of lower U.S. inventories outweighed a pickup in output in Libya, and energy sector stocks helped keep Wall Street little changed.

Stocks edged higher and Treasury yields turned slightly positive as U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration is working on changes to bank regulations and his proposed infrastructure bill "may" top $1 trillion.

Political risks from a meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders, as well as the upcoming French presidential election, kept investors cautious. Earlier, Treasury yields touched their lowest since late February and were not far from their lowest since November.

On Wall Street, indexes turned positive as Trump laid out his plans, even if investors have grown weary of his administration's ability to deliver on campaign promises after his effort to reform healthcare stalled in Congress.

Trade was high on investors' minds ahead of a possibly contentious meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which Trump expects "will be a very difficult one."

"Investors are having to go through a period of realism," said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia.

"Much of what was proposed (by the Trump administration) was either not going to make it or be a watered down version or be greatly delayed," he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.04 points, or 0.15 percent, to 20,681.25, the S&P 500 lost 0.91 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,357.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.72 points, or 0.03 percent, to 5,892.96.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.03 percent.

### TITLE: 
INTERVIEW-Snapdeal looking to raise $100 mln from SoftBank, other investors

### TEXT: 
MUMBAI, April 4 (Reuters) - Indian online retailer Snapdeal is looking to raise just over $100 million from existing shareholders including Japan's SoftBank and new investors, its chief financial officer said.

The company, which last year lost its second place in India's fiercely competitive online retail market to Amazon.com Inc, aims to become profitable in two years but faces falling cash reserves.

CFO Anup Vikal said Snapdeal has enough cash for this year, after sources told Reuters last month that the company was seeking investment to shore up its finances after unsuccessful talks with Chinese funds and existing investor Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

"About a $100 million plus is what we need, until we start being independent," Vikal told Reuters in an interview late on Monday.

Vikal said some of Snapdeal's existing investors including SoftBank, its largest backer, were willing to participate in the fundraising.

SoftBank declined to comment on the matter.

India's burgeoning online retail sector is led by home-grown player Flipkart.

Industry sources say that Snapdeal's loss of the No. 2 spot and its lack of profitability mean it will have to raise money at a much lower valuation than the $6.5 billion valuation it enjoyed a year ago after a fund raising led by Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.

Snapdeal last raised slightly over $200 million via two separate funding rounds in 2016.

The company's logistics unit Vulcan Express and e-commerce solutions provider Unicommerce will break even in the quarter to June, giving a fillip to its profitability plan, Vikal said.

Snapdeal has cut costs by using automated systems to reduce labor costs, renegotiated vendor contracts and it plans to let go of excess floor space at its headquarters outside New Delhi, Vikal said.

In February, the firm also laid off 600 employees and its founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal stopped drawing salaries.

The measures and a steep reduction in fulfillment costs have helped the company reduce losses sharply, said Vikal.

Vikal declined to comment on whether Snapdeal could be an acquisition target. Alibaba, according to a source, is in early talks with SoftBank about potentially merging Snapdeal with local rival Paytm.

Speaking about digital payments arm FreeCharge, which sources say Snapdeal is looking to sell, Vikal said the company evaluates any "inbound interest" and some international players had shown interest in becoming partners in the business.

UPDATE 1-India, Britain talk up post-Brexit trade prospects

### TEXT: 
* Hammond plays down risks of "hard" Brexit

* Indian finance minister open to free trade deal

* Governments to back energy, renewables investments

* Indian borrowers plan to issue 'masala' bonds (Updates with Hammond on visas)

NEW DELHI, April 4 (Reuters) - India and Britain on Tuesday talked up their prospects of developing a new trading relationship, as their finance ministers met to prepare for the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.

British finance minister Philip Hammond flew in to New Delhi for talks with Indian counterpart Arun Jaitley, days after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the formal start of the Brexit process.

Hammond played down the risks of a so-called "hard Brexit", in which Britain would lose access to the markets of the bloc's other 27 nations if the two sides cannot reach a consensus deal within a two-year deadline.

"We have made the decision that we will not be part of the structure of the European Union, but we've also made very clear that we want to negotiate the maximum possible open trade relationship with the European Union," Hammond told a news conference after a joint economic and financial dialogue.

"We hope to be able to negotiate a deep and special relationship with the European Union that will allow us to go on trading and investing in each other's economy, but at the same time allow us to rebuild our relationships with our partners and allies around the world."

May received a cool reception on her first visit to India last November, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressing the importance not only of trade but also of freedom of movement for his country's skilled workers.

Hammond later told UK journalists that May's goal of reducing immigration to below 100,000 people per year would not have an adverse affect on Indian skilled workers and students seeking to go to Britain.

That was a long-term target, he said: "We know that our economy today has a significant dependence on migrant labour and will continue to do so for some time to come."

Sixty percent of work visas were granted by Britain to Indian nationals - more than all other countries combined - while the number of Indians studying in the UK was rising again after a crackdown on bogus courses, he added.

HUGE ASPIRATION

In India, the world's fastest-growing large economy with a population of 1.3 billion, Britain has a massive market opportunity - but also a counterpart not known for favouring free trade.

Still, Jaitley struck a positive note by saying, "The United Kingdom, post-Brexit, is looking at a different level of relationship with India. And there's a huge aspiration in India itself also to add to and improve on this relationship."

No formal negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement would be possible until Britain has formally left the European Union, but Hammond said the two sides would have a "deep discussion" in the meantime.

In a joint statement, the ministers highlighted a pact for each country to put 120 million pounds ($149 million) into a joint fund under India's National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to invest in energy and renewables.

They also discussed efforts to make India's rupee currency more freely tradeable on international markets, and promote so-called 'masala' bonds, by which Indian firms borrow in their own currency from investors in the City of London.

The National Highways Authority of India, the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency and the Indian Railway Finance Corporation all plan to issue masala bonds in the coming months, they added. ($1=0.8035 pounds) (Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Hugh Lawson)

### TITLE: 
Many Indian tech workers are stuck in limbo, waiting for U.S. visa reform

### TEXT: 
"Even after spending 7 years in this country, I still feel I'm not a part of mainstream America," Jaiswal said. "In 2010, I thought, 'This is America. Everyone is welcome. There is no discrimination.' But when I came here, after three years, I realized, this is not the case."

Indians are among the top nationalities that naturalize as American each year, according to immigration regulators.

But it's a much more arduous path than other countries. While many Indian immigrants enter the U.S. each year on temporary H-1B visas, permanent residency green cards are capped: Only 7 percent of green cards can be issued to nationals of each country each year.

That means up to 70 percent of H-1B visa holders are competing for less than 7 percent of green cards allotted to Indians each year.

"From the time that you decide to settle in America to the time you get a green card is a 10 year journey," Kapadia said. "During 10 years, you've contributed to the society legally and you're on the path to citizenship. That's a journey."

Rishi Bhilawadikar released a new film this spring, "For Here or to Go," about Indians' journey through the U.S. immigration system.

"The pathway to getting the green card is just very, very difficult," Bhilawadikar said. "If you come from India and China, you go to the back of the line...the most productive years of your life you're stuck in limbo."

He has had to stay at large companies to sponsor his visa, limiting his career growth. That's not uncommon, said Manan Mehta. Mehta runs Unshackled, an early stage venture fund for immigrant-founded start-ups, which helps founders navigate the U.S. immigration system.

"You are completely beholden to your employer, and they are completely beholden to circumstances," Bhilawadikar said.

Despite spending all of his twenties in U.S. universities and jobs, until he gets a green card, Jaiswal can't permanently call the U.S. home. Jaiswal, who got his H-1B visa in 2013, said he feels he's behind his childhood friends who decided to go to school in places like Canda, where they could quickly naturalize.

"I would definitely do it differently," Jaiswal said. "If you took me back before 2010, rewound the time. I would not come here. I would go someplace else. Because I came for my education — I could have gone many other places, but I chose the U.S. It doesn't matter if I live here or I don't live here, I love this country. It's an awesome country..... but if you look at it what is happening to us, I would have thought about other options."

But as it stands, Jaiswal wants to stay in the U.S.— he actively meets with politicians across the country advocating for immigration reform. Going back to India now means leaving his professional network and friends he has known his whole adult life, and his wife, who attends graduate school in New York City.

"I have friends here," Jaiswal said. "I'm not in touch with many people there. Now I'm in my 30s. If I go back, I would be starting from scratch."

He said that he would rather have known how hard it would be to become a permanent resident at the beginning, so he could have made the best choice.

"If I had been applying for my H-1B and there was the 7 percent cap [like with green cards] ... at least I would have clarity of thought," Jaiswal said. "They cannot block us when we are at the finishing line. Before the race starts, if you are going to run further, you're going to get stuck."

INSIGHT-RBS rising from ruins as shadow of former self

### TEXT: 
* RBS to shut its toxic assets unit in recovery milestone

* Has shed 1.6 trillion pounds of assets since 2008 bailout

* Future shape of bank and growth prospects still uncertain

* GRAPHIC-Rise and fall of RBS assets: http://tmsnrt.rs/2mPV7La

LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Nine years after the beginning of a 45-billion-pound ($56 billion) bailout by the British government, Royal Bank of Scotland is emerging from its restructuring process a shadow of what was once the biggest lender in the world.

RBS had a balance sheet of 2.4 trillion pounds in 2008 - almost double Britain's annual economic output at the time - having staged a meteoric rise from being a small Scottish lender in the early 1990s.

Since the bailout it has offloaded billions of pounds of assets a week, as it tries to shrink down to being a simple UK-focused lender.

Later this year RBS will shut its Capital Resolution division, which has sold off large chunks of its huge stockpile of unwanted assets. The closure will mark a milestone in the bank's road to recovery, with its balance sheet around 1.6 trillion pounds lighter than when its great sell-off began. "For the first time in a long time there is a distinction between yesterday and tomorrow," Mark Bailie, who runs the unit told Reuters in an interview at the lender's lender's ultra-modern glass-and-steel offices in London's financial district.

RBS has undergone a huge asset sale, ranging from a fleet of aircraft in Beijing and the largest hospital in Sydney, to a golf course 110 km from the nearest road in Florida, and a graveyard in the U.S. Deep South.

The steep and ongoing asset-shedding, plus the deep staff and IT systems overhaul still to come, mean the future shape of RBS and its growth potential are still unknown propositions for investors, according to shareholders and analysts. "I think it is not investable at the current time. There is just too much more work to be done," said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Brothers, which holds some RBS shares.

Britain's government has ruled out reducing its stake in the bank until it resolves a multi-billion pound U.S. fine for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities and resolves its state aid requirements.

The bank's relatively small size now and the cost of its nine-year overhaul is raising questions from politicians and industry experts over whether taxpayers - who already face a paper loss of 29 billion pounds on their investment - will see the kind of stellar RBS growth needed to retrieve all their cash.

Few in the banking sector or government believe rescuing and reducing RBS was the wrong decision, given the risks it posed to the wider financial system. A collapse could have triggered a run on every bank in Britain.

Still, RBS's story illustrates the perils of bailouts at a time when state intervention is back in focus in Europe; while EU regulations have been tightened to make state bailouts a last resort, the Rome government is nonetheless seeking permission from European authorities to bail out debt-laden Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two smaller Italian banks.

An RBS spokesman directed queries on whether taxpayers would retrieve their money to comments by Chief Executive Ross McEwan last year when he said it was possible the state would not get its full investment back.

A spokesman for the Treasury said any future sale of its stake is dependent on market conditions, and that the government will seek value for money for taxpayers.

90 BILLION BILL

It was three weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers crippled global credit markets in 2008 that Britain's then finance minister Alistair Darling had to make a snap decision to buy RBS.

The giant bank was hurtling towards bankruptcy so fast no one in government had a chance to find out exactly what it owned or how to value it.

Reuters calculations based on RBS's financial statements going back to the crisis show how extreme the turnaround has been since then.

RBS's management has been selling or running off on average 3 billion pounds worth of assets every week, according to the analysis which tracked the size of the bank's balance sheet from 2008 onwards.

That's the equivalent of selling London's Shard Western Europe's tallest skyscraper every five days.

In total about 1.6 trillion pounds of assets have been stripped out of RBS's balance sheet - equivalent to the economic output of Brazil.

Bailie, 44, a qualified accountant, was tasked with shedding much of these unwanted assets.

"You had an unsustainable balance sheet, an unsustainable culture and an unsustainable cost base and, therefore, I do think it will be the biggest turnaround ever done," he said.

Much is yet to be done, according to the other senior RBS source who said the bank had three to four years of cutbacks ahead.

Tasks range from reducing the number of payment systems from 140 to 10, and mortgage processing systems from five to one, to cutting thousands of back-office staff, said the source, who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak publicly. Reuters calculations also put a final cost on RBS's lending losses in terms of write-offs, plus the writedowns on assets, as well as restructuring costs, legal bills and fines.

It tops 90 billion pounds.

That could rise further with the bank waiting to end a string of legal issues, including the U.S. fine and a lawsuit from shareholders over a rights issue it launched months before its bailout.

Analysts say the bank's ongoing restructuring, legal issues and growth concerns, now it has shed assets in its lucrative investment banking business, U.S. and insurance operations, make it difficult to recommend investing in.

Of 23 analysts covering RBS stock, only two have a "buy" recommendation, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"Someone looked at RBS and said it's a lovely piece of fruit but it has a brown rotten bit, let's cut that out," said Seb Walker, a managing director at data analytics firm Tricumen. "Then you always end up cutting deeper and deeper and you're left with a tiny core that no longer has much fruit on it."

LAST ONES STANDING

Bailie's office is on the 10th floor of RBS's London offices, where he commands a team of about 200 employees who are still selling soured loans, as well large stakes in companies amassed during the bank's years of rapid growth.

They work beneath fluorescent signs that say "The Clearing Warehouse", "The Wind Down Merchants", "The Salvage Crew" and "The Last Ones Standing".

Visiting the bank's branch in Chennai, south India, Bailie said local staff took him to a strong room to demonstrate one reason why closing the business might not be straightforward.

He recalls a colleague opening a safe to reveal 1.2 million post-dated cheques. They often perform the role of direct debits in India, with customers sending a series to their bank, which makes the payments to the relevant companies at the correct times.

RBS had to find a new lender for each customer.

"That was an interesting moment when I thought, hmm, are we going to be able to do this?" Bailie said.

Bailie's wind-down unit also contains smaller and more esoteric assets that are the legacy of RBS's expansion, including an abstract sculpture called 'Rock Form' by Barbara Hepworth housed in a shopping centre owned by RBS.

Bailie said this was among the hardest things the bank had to sell, because prospective buyers of the shopping centre in the west of England didn't want to insure the artwork to keep it there. But it was precious to the local population.

Bailie's hope is that RBS's problems are close to being resolved and that they can now spend more time talking about the smaller, safer, profitable business emerging from the husk of the former bank.

"This thing makes a billion pounds a quarter. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel."

Tightening H-1B regulations does not make 'economic sense'; here's why

### TEXT: 
A sizable number of these visas tend to go to the technology sector, where many tech companies hire Indian nationals in a range of technical roles either directly or through outsourcing firms such as Infosys or Tata Consultancy Services. Critics of the H-1B system have said that the system is set up for some companies to exploit and hire low-wage foreign workers in place of Americans.

"Domestic workers (in the U.S.) think what the Indian companies, in particular, are doing is what's called body shopping — they're taking in Indian workers and giving them jobs that should be given to American workers," Crabtree said.

He explained that the way the H-1B visa system is being used has changed over time. It was originally designed to attract foreigners who could set up big, innovative companies. "(The program) has morphed into a system where (it is bringing in) the people who are installing software packages," said Crabtree.

Given President Donald Trump has adopted an 'America First' stance, Crabtree expects changes to the H-1B program are now inevitable, but he cautioned anything drastic could have a knock-on effect on sectors crucial for the growth of the U.S. economy. The U.S. has already announced a temporary suspension of the expedited processing service for H-1B petitions for up to six months.

"What they are doing today is just a tiny tweak that isn't really going to affect anyone very much. The risk is that coming down the tracks are much, much bigger changes to the system which will be much more damaging," he said.

While tighter H-1B regulations could affect the U.S. adversely through skill shortages, Asia, in particular, could stand to benefit from an influx of skilled individuals either returning or emigrating to places like Singapore, China and India.

India to cut Iranian oil purchases in row over gas field

### TEXT: 
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Reuters) - Indian state refiners will cut oil imports from Iran in 2017/18 by a fifth, as New Delhi takes a more assertive stance over an impasse on a giant gas field that it wants awarded to an Indian consortium, sources familiar with the matter said.

India, Iran's biggest oil buyer after China, was among a handful of countries that continued to deal with the Persian Gulf nation despite Western sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.

However, previously close ties have been strained since the lifting of some sanctions last year as Iran adopts a bolder approach in trying to get the best deal for its oil and gas.

Unhappy with Tehran, India's oil ministry has asked state refiners to cut imports of Iranian oil.

"We are cutting gradually, and we will cut more if there is no progress in the matter of the award of Farzad B gas field to our company," one of the Indian sources said.

Indian refiners told a National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) representative about their plans to cut oil imports by a fifth to 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 240,000 bpd, officials present at the meeting said.

Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Corp will reduce imports by 20,000 bpd each to about 80,000 bpd. Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will together cut imports by about 10,000 bpd to roughly 30,000 bpd, they said.

In turn, NIOC threatened to cut the discount it offers to Indian buyers on freight from 80 percent to about 60 percent, the officials added.

No comment was available from the Indian companies or NIOC.

Cutting imports from Iran amid an OPEC-led supply cut aimed at propping up the market exposes India's refiners to the risk of struggling to find reasonably priced alternatives.

"We expect that the market is currently undersupplied and that the draws in inventory are coming," U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note to clients this week, adding it expected crude prices of around $60 a barrel by the fourth quarter.

Despite this, Indian oil industrials said they saw no major impact from cutting Iranian imports, mainly due to their specific requirements.

"Their main requirement is lighter oil, and light oil will remain in oversupply despite OPEC cuts, as OPEC cuts are mainly medium heavy sour," said Ehsan ul Haq of KBC Energy Economics.

Prices of light crude have fallen recently, thanks largely to soaring output in the United States, which is not involved in the production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

From April last year to February 2017, India imported 542,400 bpd from Iran, compared to 225,522 bpd a year earlier. Average oil volumes supplied by Iran over this period were the highest on record.

INDIA'S GAS PLAN

At the heart of the spat is that a group of Indian oil companies headed by Oil and Natural Gas Corp wants to develop Iran's Farzad B gas field.

Iran has yet to hand out a concession that would allow its development.

ONGC Videsh has submitted a $3 billion development plan to Iranian authorities to develop the offshore field estimated to hold reserves of 12.5 trillion cubic feet, with a lifetime of 30 years.

Under sanctions, Iran was banned from the global financial system, preventing the field's development.

India was one of a few countries still supplying Iran with goods, devising a complex payment mechanism to help Tehran access non-sanctioned items including medicines.

As new options have opened up for Tehran since the lifting of sanctions, Iran may now be awaiting better bids for Farzad B.

"They (Tehran) are playing hardball ... We don't see any forward movement on that (Farzad B)... So we have reduced (crude) imports," the Indian official said. (Editing by Dale Hudson)

### summary: 
Unhappy with Tehran, India's oil ministry has asked state refiners to cut imports of Iranian oil.
Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Corp will reduce imports by 20,000 bpd each to about 80,000 bpd.
Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will together cut imports by about 10,000 bpd to roughly 30,000 bpd, they said.
Despite this, Indian oil industrials said they saw no major impact from cutting Iranian imports, mainly due to their specific requirements.

### TITLE: 
UPDATE 2-Rosneft-led deal to buy India's Essar delayed until April

### TEXT: 
* Essar Oil deal is biggest foreign acquisition in India

* Was expected to close by March 31

* Over a dozen Indian banks must approve deal

* First signed in Oct, completion now expected in April (Adds VTB comments)

NEW DELHI/MOSCOW, March 31 (Reuters) - The purchase of Indian refiner Essar Oil by a consortium led by Russian oil company Rosneft has been delayed by a few weeks, the two sides said on Friday, because some Indian lenders to Essar have yet to sign off on the deal.

The $12.9 billion deal, in which Rosneft is set to take a 49 percent stake in Essar to pursue its global expansion, was expected to close by the end of this month.

Russia's second-biggest bank VTB, which is involved in financing the deal, has said that 19 more days would be needed to settle all the payments.

"The closure of the deal is delayed by a few weeks due to the pending approvals from the Indian banks. Both parties are still committed to close this deal as soon as the few remaining approvals from the banks are obtained," the bank said in emailed comments to Reuters.

The deal, the largest foreign acquisition of an Indian company, would give Rosneft a foothold in the growing Indian market. It already operates in a number of regions, including Europe and Latin America.

A 49 percent share will be split between commodities trader Trafigura and Russian investor United Capital Partners (UCP).

The billionaire Ruia brothers would retain a 2 percent stake.

"The closing was postponed into April because the buyers were dealing with 28 Indian banks that had credit lines with Essar Oil," a source close to the transaction said.

The source added that separate debt of holding company Essar Global was also affecting negotiations indirectly as some banks were lenders to both Essar Global and Essar Oil.

Essar Oil operates a 400,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Vadinar on India's west coast and sells fuels through its 2,470 filling stations across the country.

"The parties are working towards obtaining the requisite approvals to complete the transaction," Essar said on Friday.

The Economic Times reported last week that one of Essar's creditors, India's LIC, had demanded dues from Essar to give its clearance to the deal.

NEW DELHI/MOSCOW, March 31 (Reuters) - The purchase of Indian refiner Essar Oil by a consortium led by Russian oil company Rosneft has been delayed, the two sides said on Friday, because some Indian lenders to Essar have yet to sign off on the deal.

The $12.9 billion deal, in which Rosneft is set to take a 49 percent stake in Essar and another 49 percent will be split between commodities trader Trafigura and Russian investor United Capital Partners (UCP), was expected to close this month.

Russia's second-biggest bank VTB, which is involved in financing the deal, said this week it hoped to finish the acquisition this week, but that 19 more days would be needed to settle all the payments.

"The parties are working towards obtaining the requisite approvals to complete the transaction. We are hopeful that the deal will be completed in the upcoming few weeks," Essar said on Friday.

Two Russian sources close to the deal, announced during a visit to India by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, had said the deal was set to complete on March 15.

Officially, all the parties had previously said the transaction was expected to close in the first quarter. A Rosneft spokesman confirmed on Friday the timing of the completion had slipped. UCP and Trafigura declined to comment.

Europe shares close lower as US payrolls miss estimates; Syria missile strike in focus

### TEXT: 
The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.13 percent Friday, with most sectors trading in positive territory. Oil & Gas rose in reaction to the U.S. missile strike in Syria and closed the day up 0.6 percent. Brent closed the day up 0.55 percent, trading at $55.18 a barrel.

Basic resources stocks initially led the falls on Friday trading, following a decision from the European Union to raise import duties on Chinese steel, but also ended the day up 0.04 percent, scraping into positive territory. On the other end of the spectrum were telecoms and insurance, which led the falls, down 0.43 percent and 0.31 percent respectively.

Meanwhile, U.S. stocks opened mostly flat Friday following the attacks and news that job growth missed expectations. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 98,000 in March, well below the 180,000 anticipated, despite the unemployment rate falling to 4.5 percent.

Looking at individual European stocks, Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management were among the best-performing stocks following a ratings upgrade. Mediaset Espana, Spain's largest television network, jumped 3.2 percent following an upgrade from JP Morgan during early trade before settling up 1.6 percent at the end of the day.

On the other end of the benchmark, Swedish packaging company BillerudKorsnas fell 4.7 percent by the end of Friday after a profit warning. Online retailer Ocado dropped 5.3 percent following a rating downgrade by UBS. Also, Vivendi's shares closed slightly lower after the entertainment-to-telecoms conglomerate said it would pay $26.4 million to end a 15-year U.S. lawsuit over a big merger.

Oil jumps, Asian equities mostly higher as US fires dozens of missiles at targets in Syria

### TEXT: 
Asian markets had a choppy session on Friday after oil prices surged more than 2 percent and the Nikkei fell to a four-month low earlier in the session after the U.S. fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield.

The missile strikes occured as President Donald Trump was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

A U.S. military official told NBC that 59 tomahawks had been fired from U.S. navy destroyers, which hit an airfield near Homs. The missiles hit aircraft and infrastructure including the runway, NBC reported. There has been no word on casualties yet, but no people were targeted, the official told NBC.

In a statement, Trump said he had called for the military strike in response to a chemical attack in a rebel-held area in northern Syria.

The missile attack was launched at 8:40 am HK/SIN on Friday, or 8:40 pm EDT on Thursday evening.

On the data front, the U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs last month, well below the expected gain of 180,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent. Wage growth was not as strong either, with average hourly earnings up by 2.7 percent on an annualized basis.

"It is certainly the most unusual jobs report I've seen in a while," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "There was something for everybody."

Futures and Treasury yields slipped after the jobs report was released, with the 10-year note yield briefly dipping below 2.3 percent to hit its lowest level since late November.

"Investors are taking this as a sign they should be a little more cautious in their portfolios," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "While the headline payroll was considerably weaker, it was more of a mixed report when you look at the other components."

Investors were also contending with a U.S. airstrike in Syria, which sent 59 Tomahawk missiles Thursday night.

The missiles targeted the Shayrat air base near Homs, and were in response to a Tuesday chemical weapons attack. Officially announcing the strike, President Donald Trump said the targeted airfield had launched the chemical attack on a rebel-held area, and he called on other nations to oppose Syria's embattled leader.

Overnight, Dow futures tumbled around 100 points, but managed to retrace most losses.

"The military response last night was in keeping with what the U.S. has done in the past," said Brown Brothers' Clemons. "I think that's giving the market some comfort for now. But if the situation escalates, ... that could bee a negative for sentiment in the market."

Trump ordered the airstrike as he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

The U.S. dollar rose 0.48 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 111.21.

"Every time there is an international event, there is a flight to safety and the dollar is seen as a safe haven," said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. "That's why, even after a pretty lousy jobs number, you're seeing the dollar hold its ground."

Other data released Friday included wholesale inventories, which rose 0.4 percent. The Atlanta Fed also slashed its first-quarter GDP forecast to 0.6 percent from 1.2 percent, citing weak car sales, among other factors.

Oil settles at $52.24, up 1.04 percent, following US missile strike in Syria

### TEXT: 
Oil traded near a one-month high on Friday after the United States fired missiles at a Syrian government airbase, sending shockwaves through global markets and raising concerns that the conflict could spread in the oil-rich region.

The toughest U.S. action yet in Syria's six-year-old civil war has ramped up geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East.

Oil, gold, foreign exchange and bonds initially reacted strongly to the attack but reversed some of the sharp moves later in the session after the release of weaker than expected monthly U.S. employment figures.

U.S. oil rigs rose for the week ended April 7 by 10, to 672 rigs, data from Baker Hughes revealed on Friday. This marks the twelfth week in a row that drillers added more rigs.

Brent crude futures were up 29 cents at $55.17 a barrel after reaching an intraday peak of $56.08, the highest since March 7, shortly after the U.S. missile strike was announced.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were last up 40 cents at $52.10 a barrel, having reached an intraday high of $52.94.

US Treasurys jump after Syria attack and weaker-than-expected jobs report

U.S. government debt prices initially rose on Friday as investors digested the decision of President Donald Trump to launch strikes against a Syrian airfield and a soft jobs report.

Later in the trading day, bond prices dropped after New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said the U.S. should consider limited adjustments to multiple financial reforms put in place following the financial crisis.

The U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs last month, well below the expected gain of 180,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent. Elsewhere, wholesale trade data showed inventories rose 0.4 percent, more than expected.



The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was higher at around 2.368 percent after hitting its lowest level since late November. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond also was higher at 2.994 percent. Yields move inversely to prices.

On Thursday night, two U.S. destroyers based in the Eastern Mediterranean fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which the U.S. said was in retaliation to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people, a charge denied by authorities in Damascus.



The Syrian army said the attack killed 6 people and caused extensive damage, while Moscow called the strike "thoughtless" and requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

Bombings at Egyptian Coptic churches kill 36, injure more than 100

### TEXT: 
At least 36 people were killed and more than 100 injured in bomb attacks on two Coptic churches on Palm Sunday, in the latest assault on a religious minority increasingly targeted by Islamist militants.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, which come a week before Coptic Easter and in the same month that Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Egypt.



The first bombing, in Tanta, a Nile Delta city less than 100 kilometers outside Cairo, killed at least 25 and injured at least 78, Egypt's Ministry of Health said.

The second, carried out just a few hours later by a suicide bomber in Alexandria, hit the historic seat of the Coptic Pope, killing 11, including three police officers, and injuring 35, the ministry added.

Egypt's Interior Ministry says a blast at the Alexandria was caused by a suicide bomber who tried to storm the entrance before being stopped by police. The ministry says three policemen were among those killed in the attack. It was the second of two attacks on Coptic churches that were packed with worshipers celebrating Palm Sunday.

Pope Tawadros, who had attended mass at Saint Mark's Cathedral, was still in the building at the time of the explosion but was not harmed, the Ministry of Interior said.

The bombings come as Islamic State's branch in Egypt appears to be stepping up attacks and threats against Christians.

In February, Christian families and students fled Egypt's North Sinai province after a spate of targeted killings.

Those attacks came after one of the deadliest on Egypt's Christian minority, when a suicide bomber hit its largest Coptic cathedral, killing at least 25.

Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. Thousands gathered outside the church in Tanta shortly after the blast, some wearing black, crying, and describing a scene of carnage.

"There was blood all over the floor and body parts scattered," said a Christian woman who was inside the church.

"There was a huge explosion in the hall. Fire and smoke filled the room and the injuries were extremely severe," another Christian woman, Vivian Fareeg, said

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prime Minister Sherif Ismail are set to visit the Tanta site on Sunday and Sisi has ordered an emergency national defense council meeting, state news reported.



'We feel targeted'

A shift in Islamic State's tactics, which has waged a low-level conflict for years in the Sinai peninsula against soldiers and police, to targeting Christian civilians and broadening its reach into Egypt's mainland is a potential turning point in a country trying to prevent a provincial insurgency from spiraling into wider sectarian bloodshed.

No 'disastrous economic failure' for Britain after Brexit, says Italy's deputy finance chief

### TEXT: 
Italy's deputy finance minister has called for a more realistic and measured assessment of the Brexit process and how the U.K.'s split from the European Union will affect economies across the continent.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Finance Workshop in Cernobbio, Italy, Enrico Morando said there would be no Doomsday scenario for Britain but claimed there were still risks for the U.K. economy after the breakup is complete.

"To be honest with you, I think that Brexit is a greater threat to the U.K. economy than for the economy of the European Union," he said Saturday.

"It is not as easy to predict, as those who assumed catastrophic consequences. In my opinion those who have prophesied for magnificent consequences from the U.K. leaving haven't taken into account the positive and negative interest points from both sides of the field, and it should be done in a more balanced manner," he added.

Looking at the negotiations - which are now formally underway - Morando said there must be a "certain restraint" from commentators who should refrain from "extremism" and "radicalism". It shouldn't be assumed the U.K. would be involved in a "disastrous economic failure" because of its choice, said Morando.

"Let's not even go back to the famous phrase that when there is fog in the (English) channel, the continent is cut off, as that is very much not the case," he said. He added that U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union must be respected by governments of all member countries and called for transparent negotiations.

Swedish police say truck attack suspect showed IS sympathies

### TEXT: 
Swedish police said on Sunday that the suspect in the Stockholm truck attack was known to have expressed sympathies with extremist organisations, including Islamic state.

Clashes at French far-right leader Le Pen rally in Corsica

### TEXT: 
Skirmishes broke out on Saturday ahead of a campaign rally by French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, prompting the removal of more than a dozen protesters and the evacuation of the hall in Ajaccio, Corsica.

The latest polls ahead of the April-May, two-round presidential election show Le Pen - leader of the anti-immigrant National Front - neck-and-neck with centrist Emmanuel Macron, who is expected to beat her in the runoff.

Polls also show that right behind them, far-left veteran Jean-Luc Melenchon has risen rapidly in opinion polls after his performance in a televised debate early this week, drawing level with conservative candidate Francois Fillon, whose presidential bid has been tainted by corruption charges.

How soaring oil prices could cost you at the gas pump, RBC says

### TEXT: 
Get ready to open up your wallet a lot wider at the gas pump.

A major Wall Street bank is reiterating its bullish call on crude oil, as the fossil fuel sits at four week highs following this week's U.S. missile attack on Syria.

RBC Capital Markets Head of Commodity Strategy and CNBC Contributor Helima Croft predicts prices will climb to the low $60s within months — a nearly 20 percent move from current levels. That would translate to roughly a $1.80 gasoline spot price.

"We see it grinding higher over the back half of the year," Croft told "Futures Now," recently. "We're coming out of refinery maintenance season. So, we're going to start to see draws of the U.S. inventory. Those high U.S. inventory numbers have really been depressing prices."

Summer driving season will also give prices a "boost," and demand won't fall anytime soon, according to Croft.

Crude initially jumped two percent in reaction to U.S. airstrikes on Syria before giving back some gains. The commodity settled up one percent on Friday to $52.24 a barrel, its highest settle in a month. However, crude is still down nearly three percent so far this year.



The latest activity overseas isn't moving the needle on Croft's oil forecast... yet.

She said there's no real immediate supply disruption threat, since Syria's six-year-old civil war has moved the majority of local production offline.

However, she pointed out a few wildcards, which include potential new strains between Russia and the Sunni Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, and whether the U.S. strikes could give hardline candidates a lift in Iran's presidential election in May. These situation could also propel prices higher.

In a research note out Friday, Croft wrote, "If these strikes are not followed up by a serious effort to oust the Syrian leader [Bashar Assad], none of these scenarios may materialize and the oil implications will remain negligible. However, given that President Trump had previously signaled deep disdain for humanitarian interventions and Middle Eastern military engagements, we are now in uncharted waters...."

Nearer term, Croft lists OPEC as a key factor in the direction of oil prices. She believes OPEC's next meeting on May 25 could have more immediate impact.

"We see that 1.8 million barrel a day OPEC, Non-OPEC coordinated cut. We see them rolling that over for another six months. That's why we are constructive going into the back half of the year," she said.

"If you are sovereign head of state in one of these oil producing countries, you fear more than anything a price reversal back into the $40s or the $30s."

### TITLE: 
North Korea says Syria airstrikes prove its nukes justified

### TEXT: 
North Korea has vowed to bolster its defenses to protect itself against airstrikes like the ones President Donald Trump ordered against an air base in Syria.

The North called the airstrikes "absolutely unpardonable" and said they prove its nuclear weapons are justified to protect the country against Washington's "evermore reckless moves for a war."

The comments were made by a Foreign Ministry official and carried Sunday by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency. The report did not name the official, which is common in KCNA reports.

The airstrikes, announced shortly after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up dinner at a two-day summit in Florida last week, were retaliation against Syrian President Bashar Assad for a chemical weapons attack against civilians caught up in his country's long civil war.

"Some forces are loud-mouthed that the recent U.S. military attack on Syria is an action of warning us but we are not frightened by it," the report said, adding that the North's "tremendous military muscle with a nuclear force as its pivot" will foil any aggression by the U.S.

"We will bolster up in every way our capability for self-defense to cope with the U.S. evermore reckless moves for a war and defend ourselves with our own force," it said.

North Korea has long claimed that the United States is preparing to conduct similar precision strikes against its territory or even launch an all-out invasion. It claims its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent to the U.S. military threat.

Washington denies it has any intention of invading the North.

Tensions have been even higher than usual over the past few weeks because annual war games between the U.S. and South Korean militaries are underway. The exercises this year are the biggest ever and have included stealth fighter training and other maneuvers that are particularly sensitive to North Korea.

Ford CEO 'encouraged' by US-China future as Trump, Xi end summit

### TEXT: 
Ford Motor CEO Mark Fields is feeling optimistic about the outlook for U.S.-China relations, the executive told CNBC on Saturday, a day after the conclusion of a summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On Friday, Trump said that the two leaders had made progress on tough bilateral issues as both men met at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump, who has previously taken aim at China's currency and trade policies and made protectionism a centerpiece of his economic policy, hailed Xi's visit in a tweet early Saturday.

However, Trump added that "only time will tell" whether the two countries could find common ground on trade.

"I was very encouraged by the fact that the two Presidents—and particularly very early in President Trump's term—have decided to come together and first start the process of establishing a relationship," Fields told CNBC on the sidelines of a Ford event in Shanghai unveiling a new line-up of cars for the Chinese market.

"It's very different when you talking on the phone versus when you have had a chance to meet and break bread with that individual," he said.

Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable.

China is one of Ford's largest markets, and last year the automaker topped 1 million cars in the Asia Pacific region. Fields told CNBC that Ford expects sales in China "to be down very slightly" in 2017; however, he remains "very confident in the growth outlook."

Gold gives back morning gains in ‘disappointing’ drop

### TEXT: 
It's tough to be a certain precious metal these days.

On Friday, gold jumped to its highest level since November after the release of a March jobs report that was weaker than expected, but soon gave up its gains to settle just slightly higher on the day. Safe-haven buying stemming from the U.S. missile attack on Syria lifted demand for bullion, but that eventually evaporated.

"On a technical basis, today's a disappointing day," Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, commented Friday on CNBC's "Power Lunch."

Maley explained that with their morning spike to $1,273.30, gold futures managed to rise decisively above their 200-day moving average. However, gold futures settled a bit below that mark, at $1,257.30, and slid a bit further into the equity close — a move that was consonant with an overall snapback reaction once investors determined that the jobs report didn't actually indicate a weakening economy.

The 200-day moving average has served as "tough resistance," Maley said. "The fact that it rolled back over and it's not going to hold that level by the close is disappointing."

Looking ahead, the even more important zone for gold is where its long-term downtrend comes in. "If we break above that level, it will give us a lot of momentum," Maley said.

Long term trends 'against gold'

From a fundamental perspective, gold is torn between catalysts, according to Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global.

"The long-term economic trends are against gold — it is a strengthening recovery, you do have firming labor markets, and you also have rising interest rates," she said Friday on "Power Lunch."

On the other hand, politics in the United States and around the globe have become increasingly volatile and anxiety-making, "so that's been pushing gold up while the economic trends have been pushing it down," Sanchez added.

Capital Economics noted on Friday that "heightened political risk in the Middle East" boosted both crude and gold.

However, the firm added that "the prices of both could fall back in the near term if, as seems likely, the U.S. intervention proves to be a "one-off," also citing waning central bank demand for the yellow metal as a drag on prices.

Syrian governor confirms air base operating again

### TEXT: 
A Syrian air base targeted in a U.S. cruise missile attack is operating again, the governor of Syria's Homs province confirmed on Saturday.

The United States launched the missile strikes on Friday in response to a chemical attack that killed 90 people including 30 children. It says the Syrian government launched the attack from the Shayrat air base. Damascus has strongly denied carrying out the attack and says it does not use chemical weapons.

The Syrian army said on Friday the attack had caused extensive damage to the base, which the United States says it targeted with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles.

"The airport is operating as a first phase," Homs governor Talal Barazi told Reuters. "Planes have taken off from it," he added, without saying when.

Asked if it was true that Syrian planes were now taking off from Shayrat or that the air base is operating, a Pentagon spokesman referred questions to the Syrian government.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that reports on the war, said warplanes had taken off from the base on Friday and carried out air strikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern Homs countryside.

An activist with an opposition air raid warning service said however that the first flight from the base was on Saturday morning.

U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the runway itself had not been the target of the missile strikes.

Trump's UN envoy says ouster of al-Assad is a priority of US

### TEXT: 
President Donald Trump ordered the missile strike after watching television images of infants suffering from chemical weapons injuries.

"You pick and choose your battles and when we're looking at this, it's about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out," Haley had told reporters on March 30, just days before dozens of Syrian civilians died from chemical weapons injuries.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to take a more patient stance in regard to Assad, saying on Saturday that Washington's first priority is the defeat of Islamic State.

Once the threat from Islamic State has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria, Tillerson said in excerpts from an interview on CBSs Face the Nation, that will air in full on Sunday.

Tillerson said the United States is hopeful it can help bring parties together to begin the process of hammering out a political solution.

"If we can achieve ceasefires in zones of stabilization in Syria, then I believe - we hope we will have the conditions to begin a useful political process, Tillerson said.

Syrian forces launched further airstrikes on Saturday that killed 18 people including five children in rebel-controlled Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the civil defense rescue service reported.

Venezuelans pour into Caracas streets in anti-Maduro protest

### TEXT: 
Later, a small group of youths unsuccessfully tried to set fire to a Supreme Court office building.

The violence was condemned by the opposition leadership, who nonetheless blame Maduro's obstinacy for fueling the unrest.

They called for another protest Monday. But with Caracas shutting down for the Easter holiday — which Maduro extended by decree for three extra days — they appeared to be saving their strength for a major demonstration called for April 19.

At least 17 people were treated for injuries, according to Ramon Muchacho, a Caracas-area mayor where the demonstration took place.

Around most of Caracas, checkpoints were set up to search cars and frisk bus passengers even miles away from the clashes. As night fell, many streets still reeked of tear gas and a small group of youth burned trash and tore down street signs at busy intersections in eastern Caracas.

As the most dominant figure in the opposition over the past decade, Capriles has been at the forefront of the protests, the most combative since a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014 in which dozens of people were killed, many at the hands of security forces.

The almost-daily churn of events in what the opposition calls an "ongoing coup" by the government has energized and united the normally fractious opposition.

While opposition leaders have insisted on peaceful protest, frustration built up over 17 years of polarizing socialist rule in Venezuela is running high on both sides.

As Saturday's march began, protesters snatched a camera from crew members working for pro-government state broadcaster VTV, chasing them away from the crowd with kicks and insults. Police, meanwhile, made social media posts of mugshots of protesters taken undercover and asked for information on the unidentified "generators of violence."

Leaders in the ruling socialist party have accused the opposition of trying to provoke a bloodbath and its own coup.

The protesters on Saturday included 26-year-old Victoria Paez, who sported a baseball cap bearing the slogan "There's a Way!" from Capriles' 2012 presidential run against the late Hugo Chavez.

"Every day, the government gives us more reasons to leave our homes and protest," said Paez, who earns less than $20 a month as a chemical engineer. She said she's thinking about joining a sister and scores of college friends who have left the South American country seeking a better future.

While she said she was hopeful the world is beginning to see there are injustices in Venezuela, her father, Carlos Paez, was more pessimistic.

"Unfortunately, if there has to be bloodshed for the government to change, it won't be the first time in history," he said.

The protest movement's immediate goal apparently is to force Maduro to call elections. Authorities last year cancelled an opposition campaign to hold a recall referendum on Maduro and no date has yet been set for gubernatorial elections that were supposed to take place last year.

The government earlier jailed another major opposition figure, hardliner Leopoldo Lopez. With both seemingly out of the running, the government may be trying to manipulate the electoral playing field to leave the opposition with less viable options should the government bow to pressure and call elections before they're scheduled in 2018, analysts said.

"However, it is a risky strategy that will probably backfire," Eurasia Group said in a report Friday. "The opposition is clearly fired up and this will further their cause."

Fed 'balance sheet': What happens, why it matters, what could go wrong

### TEXT: 
Reducing the Fed's massive balance sheet could lead to higher rates sooner than some expected Thursday, 6 Apr 2017 | 9:01 AM ET | 00:47

Consider the Federal Reserve the Starship Enterprise of monetary policy: It went where no central bank had gone before, and now must plot the journey home.

The Fed already has begun one leg of the trip, as it has started raising interest rates from financial crisis-era lows. Now, it is preparing to embark on what could be the more perilous part — unwinding the $4.5 trillion of bonds it holds on its so-called balance sheet.

Central bank officials discussed in March how to address the balance sheet, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee released Wednesday. While it may just sound like arcane monetary talk, the stakes are high both for investors and consumers.

Get it right, and the Fed will have pulled off what its critics thought impossible, namely embarking on unprecedented intervention in the markets with little consequence. Get it wrong and the fallout could be dramatic, including a sharp rise in interest rates and tumult in the stock and bond markets.

Sweden identifies truck attack suspect as Uzbek native, 39

### TEXT: 
The suspect in Stockholm's deadly beer truck attack is a 39-year-old native of Uzbekistan who had been on authorities' radar previously, Swedish authorities said Saturday. The prime minister urged citizens to "get through this" and strolled through the streets of the capital to chat with residents.

Swedes flew flags at half-staff Saturday to commemorate the four people killed and 15 wounded when the hijacked truck plowed into a crowd of shoppers Friday afternoon in Stockholm. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven declared Monday a national day of mourning, with a minute of silence at noon.

Sweden's police chief said authorities were confident they had detained the man who carried out the attack.

"There is nothing that tells us that we have the wrong person," Dan Eliason told a news conference Saturday, but added he did not know whether others were involved in the attack. "We cannot exclude this."

Eliason also said police found something in the truck that "could be a bomb or an incendiary object, we are still investigating it."

Prosecutor Hans Ihrman said the suspect has not yet spoken to authorities and could not confirm whether he was a legal resident of Sweden. Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish Security Service, said security services were working with other nations' security agencies to investigate the attack, but declined to elaborate.

Police declined to comment on media reports about overnight police raids around Stockholm or if they were hunting any more suspects in the case. They said the suspect had been on their radar before but not recently, and did not explain why authorities apparently had not considered him a serious threat.

Eliason told reporters the suspect was "a more marginal character."

Sweden's health service said 10 people were still hospitalized for wounds from the attack and four of them were seriously injured.

Swedish store hit by truck regrets 'damaged goods' promotion

The Swedish department store that was rammed by a stolen beer truck, leaving four people dead and 15 injured in Stockholm, said Sunday it regrets an announcement that it would reopen two days after the deadly attack to sell damaged goods at a "reduced price."

The Ahlens department store apologized "for a bad decision" in a statement on its Facebook page. It said its motivation "was born out of the idea of standing up for transparency and not allowing evil forces take control of our lives."

The store said it would reopen Monday "without any damaged goods."

A fire broke out Friday afternoon at the store after the truck smashed into its entrance on Stockholm's pedestrian Drottninggatan street. It was quickly put out by firefighters.

Police have arrested a 39-year-old native of Uzbekistan and say they believe he deliberately drove the truck into shoppers.

Bannon, Kushner meet to clear air, end White House rift

### TEXT: 
The goal, the official said, was to unite the administration so it can focus on the agenda. The official confirmed the Kushner-Bannon meeting on the condition of anonymity in order to speak on internal manners.

Kushner and Bannon were both at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president hosted a summit with the leader of China.

Other administration officials declined to discuss staff relationships, but denied reports that a major staff shake-up is imminent. "Once again, this is a completely false story driven by people who want to distract from the success taking place in this administration," said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

In recent weeks, officials have said Kushner has taken on a larger role as Trump's main troubleshooter, which spurred speculation about a growing rift between him and Bannon. Former Trump political adviser Roger Stone has accused Kushner of leaking unfavorable stories about Bannon.

Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News who chaired the Trump presidential campaign, is considered the leader of the nationalist wing. It believes the United States has surrendered too much of its economic sovereignty via questionable trade deals and leaky immigration policies.

Other Trump advisers are more globalist, bigger supporters of trade and cooperation with international organizations like NATO. That group includes Kushner, who has emerged as a troubleshooter for the president and has clashed with Bannon.

Bannon and Kushner have been subjects of anonymous attacks in the media, as have other prominent White House officials, such as Priebus and counselor Kellyanne Conway.

### summary: 
Kushner and Bannon were both at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president hosted a summit with the leader of China.
Other administration officials declined to discuss staff relationships, but denied reports that a major staff shake-up is imminent.

Mnuchin: Will announce more Syria sanctions in the future Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 4:18 PM ET | 03:19

Asked Friday if the strike changes America's policy in Syria, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump is "not gonna telegraph his next move."

There will, however, be additional sanctions on Syria, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Friday afternoon. The sanctions will be part of the ongoing effort to "stop this type of activity," he said, referring to Assad's use of chemical weapons on his own people.

Tillerson signaled Thursday night in a joint briefing with National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster that future steps through the international political process could eventually lead to Syrian President Bashar Assad's ouster.

"Through the Geneva process, we will start a political process to resolve Syria's future in terms of its governance structure and that ultimately, in our view will lead to a resolution of Bashar al Assad's departure," Tillerson said.

Trump's overall Syria strategy — so far — is muddy, and it is unclear if he will continue to pursue a sustained military strategy in the region with the goal of foisting Assad from power, foreign policy experts said.

Former Ambassador to Syria, Ryan Crocker, said: "I frankly don't think there is [a strategy in place]. President Trump has talked the talk … now he's going to have to walk the walk."

Crocker said Trump was probably "a long way" from having a plan "but I'm heartened, as a career internationalist, that's he's making the effort."

Airbnb experimenting with site design to fight discrimination

### TEXT: 
If you've used Airbnb in the last few months you might have noticed some changes in its interface. That is because the home sharing site is downplaying several features which, according to the company, may be enabling user discrimination.

The company has been experimenting "with reducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process, and enhancing other parts of host and guests profiles with objective information," said Christopher Nulty, head of public affairs at Airbnb.

The most noticeable change is on the search listings page, which no longer displays photos of hosts alongside featured images of a home.

The modifications come three years after a Harvard study found that black hosts earn 12 percent less than non-black hosts on the site.

"There are specific types of features that allow for discrimination in an online environment," Michael Luca, a Harvard Business School Professor told CNBC recently. "Pulling the pictures off the front page of search results can have an effect on the decisions people make," he said.

Trump debunked: Start-up founders want more regulation, not less

### TEXT: 
President Donald Trump has vowed that for every new regulation, two old ones must be eliminated. An executive order he signed in February declared "it is the policy of the United States to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people." But not all businesses feel the burden, and some want more regulation, not less.

When asked about regulations they'd like to see eliminated, changed or created, many of the founders of companies on the first-ever CNBC Upstart 25 list called for regulations they'd like to see created, not stripped away. An exception was a call for less regulation on the commercial use of drones, since some companies on the list — Zume Pizza and Drone Deploy — are utilizing this technology to grow their business.

The types of regulations called for range from increased requirements around family leave to standardization contracts for musicians. But the common theme is that companies would welcome new rules as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage and grow their businesses. Here are two that topped their wish list.

Russia Role In Syrian Gas Attack Not Clear: Officials

"At a minimum, the Russians failed to rein in the Syrian regime activity," they said. "We know the Russians have chemical weapons expertise in country. We cannot talk about any complicity between the Russians and the Syrian regime in this case."

"We are carefully assessing any information that would implicate [that] the Russians knew or assisted with the Syrian capability," they said.

Russia, which supports Assad, has confirmed that Syria attacked the town on Tuesday but insists it hit a rebel-held depot that was holding "toxic" weapons, and played no role in the deadly attack itself. It has condemned the U.S. missile attack as an "act of aggression."

The Syrians, as they have in the past even in the face of United Nations condemnation, insisted again they did not use chemical weapons on Tuesday.

Assad was in danger of losing a strategic airfield some 15 miles from Khan Sheikhoun to the rebels fighting to depose him when he launched the chemical attack in what the military officials described as a "battlefield desperation decision."

There is a "high degree of confidence" that the chemical unleashed was "a nerve agent like sarin" that can short-circuit the nervous system within seconds, they said.

The U.S. military has confirmed, the officials said, that Syrian regime aircraft were over the ancient town of 52,000 in northern Idlib province southwest of Aleppo, which until Tuesday's massacre was best known for its distinctive circular beehive houses.

The deadly payload was dropped by Syrian fixed wing aircraft on the town around 6:50 a.m. local time, they said. And by 7 a.m., they detected possible evidence of the nerve agent.

Later, the officials said, they detected a Russian drone hovering over a hospital run by the al-Nusra Front where the poisoning victims — including at least 25 children — were being treated.

A short time later, the hospital was bombed by an aircraft. The U.S. is uncertain whether it was Syrian or Russian.

### TITLE: 
China tech investment flying under radar, Pentagon warns

### TEXT: 
China is investing in Silicon Valley start-ups with military applications at such a rapid rate that the United States government needs tougher controls to stem the transfer of some of America's most promising technologies, a Pentagon report says.

There are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.

In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius.

"If we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China's technological superiority," the report says.

Such concerns show that China is looming in America's rearview mirror after a decades-long campaign by Beijing to close the technological gap between the two countries. Although the race is often cast in an economic light, the Pentagon report underlines the national security threat.

In recent years, China has combined domestic subsidies with aggressive investment overseas to build its own technological know-how. A government plan, "Made in China 2025," that proposes lavishing state funds on 10 important industries has raised concerns from American and European business groups. Meanwhile, the global semiconductor industry has been shaken by Beijing-backed investment aimed at acquiring new microchip knowledge.

President Trump has said he would resist Chinese trade tactics that put American companies at a disadvantage, though it is unclear whether the topic has come up in meetings with President Xi Jinping of China that began on Thursday and continue Friday.

The report found that increasingly sophisticated commercial technology had blurred the lines between what was available to military consumers and civilian ones. Often start-ups and leading internet companies like Facebook and Google are working on products as sophisticated as anything the military has at its disposal.

"For example, V.R. for gaming is at a similar level of sophistication as the V.R. used in simulators for our armed forces," the report said, referring to virtual reality. "Facial recognition and image detection for social networking and online shopping has real application in tracking terrorists or other threats to national security," the report continued, which added that much of the autonomous vehicle and drone technology of today was developed using grants from the Pentagon.

In some cases, companies aided by those grants have since raised money from Chinese investors. Velodyne, for example, started developing light sensors for driverless cars after participating in a competition set up by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a unit of the Pentagon, in 2005. Since then, those sensors have been used on the United States Navy's unmanned surface vehicles.

Last summer, the company received a $150 million joint investment from Ford and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Baidu declined to comment on the investment.

A Velodyne spokeswoman said the round represented its first outside investment.

"The company obtained all necessary government clearances relating to the investment as part of the funding process," the spokeswoman wrote in an email. "Notably, the investments were designed to make advanced LiDAR sensors more accessible to the broader industry, resulting in the development of safer, less expensive autonomous vehicles."

Ashton B. Carter, the former secretary of defense, commissioned the report as an urgent review of what senior Pentagon officials have considered China's alarming penetration of Silicon Valley, particularly in deals that finance nascent technology that has military applications.

The report found that American private industry was mostly unaware of Beijing's efforts — many of the deals involve relatively small amounts of money — and that Washington did not have a strong understanding of the scale of the issue.

"The U.S. government does not have a holistic view of how fast this technology transfer is occurring, the level of Chinese investment in U.S. technology, or what technologies we should be protecting," the report said.

Michael A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, led the study, called "How Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation." The New York Times reviewed a copy of the unclassified report.

Mr. Carter declined to comment on the final document issued to cabinet officials last month.

The report does not offer examples of American companies that have accepted Chinese investment and then found that their sensitive technologies were transferred to China.

But it does take exception to tactics that it says Chinese funds have used to skirt government oversight. For example, it singles out Canyon Bridge, a venture capital firm that it says was formed to buy Lattice Semiconductor, an American microchip company. The firm has Chinese capital and American management expertise. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge was to obscure the source of capital to "enhance the possibility" that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.

Peter Kuo, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said that the there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund's capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.

Chinese investors plowed about $30 billion into early-stage technology through more than 1,000 funding deals between 2010 and 2016. During that time, participation from China rose to about 10 percent of total venture deals, with investment in crucial industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality accelerating in 2016, according to the report.

Among the investors identified in the report are well-known private firms and funds like Alibaba and Baidu. It also points to government-sponsored investors like Westlake Ventures, a fund in Redwood City, Calif., that is owned by the Hangzhou government, and ZGC Capital, an investor owned by 17 state-owned enterprises with an office in Santa Clara, Calif.

The rising trend in venture capital investments has occurred alongside state-directed industrial espionage and online theft, which the American government has been unable to slow, the report says. In the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Silicon Valley field office, only 10 people are dedicated to counterespionage, and F.B.I. officials said in interviews for the report that it "has very limited resources relative to the threat."

"The scale of the espionage continues to increase," the authors say. "Despite the rise in convictions, there is no way to know how big this problem really is."

Chinese state media cheer Xi-Trump meeting, say confrontation not inevitable

### TEXT: 
Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable.

The official China Daily newspaper said it was encouraging to see the two-day summit that ended on Friday "going as well as it could", after earlier "confusing signals" from Washington about how it was approaching the U.S.-China relationship.

Trump had campaigned with strident anti-China rhetoric and had angered Beijing before taking office by talking to the president of Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.

But the two sides avoided any diplomatic gaffes at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that would have tarnished the meeting in the eyes of the protocol-conscious Chinese.

China Daily said both parties appeared "equally enthusiastic about the constructive relationship they have promised to cultivate".

"This may sound surreal to those preoccupied with an 'inescapable' conflict scenario between what they see as rising and incumbent powers," the newspaper wrote in an editorial.

"But that Beijing and Washington have so far managed to do well in preventing conflicts shows confrontation is not inevitable."

### TITLE: 
Russia is already subtly signaling how it will react to the airstrike in Syria

### TEXT: 
Despite the warnings and rhetoric, Russia may be hesitant to take action that would escalate conflict with the United States in Syria.

The U.S. launched a major missile strike Thursday night on a Syrian air base following a chemical attack blamed on Syria that killed dozens, including children, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump pinned those deaths on Syrian President Bashar Assad, a leader Moscow has supported during a yearslong, seemingly intractable Syrian civil war. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.

The Russian Foreign Ministry called the strike an "egregious and obvious violation of international law," while Moscow suspended an agreement aimed to prevent U.S. fighter jets from coming into conflict with Russian planes. Russia signaled that the attack could worsen relations between Washington and Moscow.

Still, actions from both Russia and the United States suggest the two countries don't want tension between them to increase any further, said Olga Oliker, senior advisor and director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research organization.

"I don't think they want escalation. I think they want to deter escalation," Oliker said.

She noted that the U.S. warned Russia about the strike before it came, limiting its potential damage. Russia may have been able to use air defense systems at the base, where it has equipment, and decided not to, Oliker added.

Russia also took steps to publicly "diminish the effects of the strike," she said. For example, the U.S. said that all but one of the 59 missiles launched hit their targets, but Russia's Defense Ministry said only 23 of the missiles reached the base.

### TITLE: 
Singapore’s central bank likely won’t be turning hawkish any time soon

### TEXT: 
Singapore's economy may be perking up, but the central bank isn't likely to turn hawkish at this month's policy review, analysts said.

Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, said in a note on Wednesday that the question wasn't really whether Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), would stick with its neutral stance – which was the consensus view – but whether it would keep the "extended period" wording on the policy.

Goh expected the MAS announcement on April 13, although he noted the date wasn't yet officially set.

If the "extended period" wording was dropped, Goh said that would be a hawkish signal, likely sending the Singapore dollar's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) higher.

But he added that it was premature to expect that hawkish tilt.

"There is no doubt that Singapore's economic data has improved," Goh said, citing indicators including the consumer price index's (CPI) return to inflation after two years of deflation and improvements in the purchasing managers' index (PMI).

The Nikkei Singapore PMI, released Wednesday, picked up to 52.2 in March, a four-month high, up from 51.4 in February, indicating stronger improvement in the private sector. Levels above 50 indicate expansion and levels below indicate contraction.

But Goh added, "we need much stronger improvement before MAS will contemplate exiting the neutral stance," noting that the labor market remained weak.

Goh expected that the market was pricing in tightening prematurely, with the Singapore dollar NEER likely to weaken as the MAS review quashed hawkish expectations.

He recommended buying the U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar pair at 1.3979, with a 1.42 target and a stop-loss at 1.3880. The greenback was fetching 1.3981 Singapore dollars around mid-day Wednesday.

That compares with the pair's high of 1.4545 touched in early January, rising from around 1.36 before the MAS' October policy review, when it said it would maintain the neutral stance for an extended period.

The MAS uses the exchange rate, rather than interest rates, to set monetary policy because of the city-state's small size and open economy.

The city-state's central bank, which has official policy-setting meetings just twice a year, sets its monetary policy by adjusting an undisclosed trading band for the currency based on a basket of currencies weighted to reflect trade levels with the city-state.

The MAS may intervene if the currency moves outside its band; it was suspected of stepping into the market late last year as the U.S. dollar climbed over 1.45 Singapore dollars.

Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank, also expected the MAS to maintain a neutral policy.

"Both growth-inflation dynamics remain within their comfort zone and any upside (or downside) risks to their forecasts are muted for the foreseeable future," she said in a note late Tuesday.

Additionally, she noted that the Singapore dollar NEER was "bearing the brunt" of markets unwinding the Trump reflation trade; that trade had pushed the U.S. dollar higher before market concerns about U.S. President Donald

Trump's apparent inability to push his agenda through Congress erased the greenback's gains.

Ling also noted that markets don't appear willing to fully price in another two rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, likely keeping Singapore rates subdued as well.

Pricing in those increases would likely push the dollar higher and the Singapore dollar down. Interest rates in Singapore tend to follow the Fed.

Others also noted that Singapore's economic pick-up wasn't entirely rosy.

Bernard Aw, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the Nikkei Singapore PMI, pointed to "worrying trends" in the latest data.

"March saw a sharp increase in cost pressures, the steepest in over three-and-a-half years, as wage inflation gained momentum," Aw said in a statement accompanying the data. "At the same time, prices charged for Singaporean goods and services rose only modestly, indicating an on-going squeeze on margins. Unless demand increases further, this could have repercussions on investment and hiring plans in the months ahead."

Russia has 'egg on their face' after Trump airstrike, says former US ambassador to Syria

### TEXT: 
US airstrike sent 'just the right message': Expert Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 6:31 AM ET | 02:52

Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely furious after the U.S. fired cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in response to a chemical weapons attack, former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Theodore Kattouf told CNBC on Friday.

"But they have egg on their face," Kattouf, who served under the George W. Bush administration, said on "Squawk Box."

Kattouf said that Russia guaranteed in 2013 that Syria's chemical weapons arsenal would be removed or destroyed. Obviously, that did not happen "100 percent," Kattouf said.

After Thursday's U.S. missile strikes on a Syrian air base, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Russia had failed to carry out the 2013 agreement to secure Syrian chemical weapons. He said Moscow was either complicit or incompetent in its ability to uphold that deal.

Russia said the U.S. strikes against Bashar Assad's government violated international law. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin believed the U.S. attacks on Syria showed aggression against a sovereign state.

President Donald Trump ordered the attack by 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syria military air base in response to Tuesday's deadly chemical weapons attack allegedly carried out by Assad's military on a rebel-held area.

Kattouf said the strikes against Assad's government sent "just the right message."

James Stavridis, a retired admiral who served as NATO's supreme allied commander, told CNBC on Friday that the attack showed the U.S. is not afraid to use force.

"Let's face it: Part of the audience here is not just Russia, Iran and Syria. Part of the audience is (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping)," Stavridis said on "Squawk Box."

As missiles hit a Syrian air base, Trump was meeting with the Chinese president in Florida.

"Perhaps it is no coincidence that the strikes get launched while President Xi is down in Mar-a-Lago. Pretty good signal that the United States intends to play hard with North Korea," Stavridis said.

—CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld contributed to this report.

Sovereign fund to invest in new Saudi entertainment city

### TEXT: 
Saudi Arabia announced plans on Saturday to build a 334 sq km "entertainment city" south of the capital Riyadh, to feature sports, cultural and recreational facilities including a safari and a Six Flags theme park.

The kingdom's Public Investment Fund will be the main investor in the project, which will break ground in 2018 and open in 2022, according to a statement by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman carried by state news agency SPA.

Other local and international investors will also provide capital, the statement said, without elaborating on the size of the investment.

"This city will become, by God's will, a prominent cultural landmark and an important center for meeting the future generation's recreational, cultural and social needs in the kingdom," said Prince Mohammed in a statement.

U.S.-based Six Flags announced in June that it had begun talks with the Saudi government to build theme parks as part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 efforts to expand its entertainment sector and diversify the economy.

Chief Executive Jim Reid-Anderson said later in the year that the company aimed to build three parks in Saudi Arabia, with each costing between $300 million and $500 million.

The Vision 2030 reform program contains plans to shed the kingdom's austere reputation, wean the economy off oil and create jobs for young Saudis.

But developing a leisure sector is fraught with difficulties in the Islamic kingdom, which adheres to a strict social code where women are required to wear loose-fitting robes, cinemas and alcohol are banned and public spaces are gender-segregated.





### summary: 
Saudi Arabia announced plans on Saturday to build a 334 sq km "entertainment city" south of the capital Riyadh, to feature sports, cultural and recreational facilities including a safari and a Six Flags theme park.
Other local and international investors will also provide capital, the statement said, without elaborating on the size of the investment.

Life between Trump and Putin is about to get complicated after US airstrike, ex-Defense Secretary Cohen says

### TEXT: 
President Donald Trump's attack on a Syrian air base has signaled a shift in his once-cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Defense Secretary William Cohen told CNBC on Friday.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to travel to Moscow on Wednesday, a week after the U.S. military fired 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syria military air base in response to Tuesday's deadly chemical weapons attack allegedly carried out by Bashar Assad's military on a rebel-held area.

The Syrian strike "sets the tone," Cohen, a Republican who served under former President Bill Clinton, said on "Squawk Box." "Life between us is going to be somewhat different."

After Thursday's U.S. missile strikes, Tillerson said Russia had failed to carry out the 2013 agreement to secure Syrian chemical weapons. He said Moscow was either complicit or incompetent in its ability to uphold that deal.

Russia said the U.S. strikes against Assad's government violated international law. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin believed the U.S. attacks on Syria showed aggression against a sovereign state.

Cohen said one strike against Assad's government is not a strategy, but a tactic. He also said Tillerson needs more staff support at the State Department, where many top spots are still unfilled.

"We need to get the State Department really beefed up so that Secretary Tillerson can have his full team to give all the options to the president as he moves forward," Cohen said. "It won't be just military, it has to be economic."

Baghdad says US pledges continued support for Iraq's war against IS

### TEXT: 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday assured Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of continued U.S. support to defeat Islamic State, the Iraqi government said in a statement.

The two discussed the situation in Syria and the war on Islamic State in a phone call from Pence following Friday's U.S. strikes on a Syrian airbase to punish a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians this week in an area held by the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Pence "affirmed that U.S. policy in the region didn't change, its priority is to defeat Daesh in Iraq and the region," said a statement from Abadi's office.

The Shi'ite-led Iraqi government issued a statement on Friday in reaction to the events in Syria reflecting a difficult balancing act between its alliance with the United States and with Shi'ite Iran, a key backer of Assad.

The Iraqi statement condemned the chemical attack, without naming Assad, calling instead for an international investigation to identify the perpetrator.

The statement also criticized "the hasty interventions" that followed the chemical attack, in an apparent reference to the U.S. strikes.

Trump launches attack on Syria with 59 Tomahawk missiles

Experts weigh in on the U.S. launching missiles at Syria after deadly chemical attack Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 11:35 AM ET | 01:13

The U.S. military attacked a Syria-government airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles on Thursday evening.

The missiles targeted the Shayrat air base near Homs, and were in response to a Tuesday chemical weapons attack. Officially announcing the strike, President Donald Trump said the targeted airfield had launched the chemical attack on a rebel-held area, and he called on other nations to oppose Syria's embattled leader.

"On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack," Trump said Thursday night.

A U.S. defense official called the U.S. strike a "one-off," Reuters reported. Nine civilians including four children were killed, the Syrian state news agency claimed, but the Pentagon said civilians were not targeted.

### TITLE: 
Is Singapore’s property market headed for a quick upswing?

### TEXT: 
After a long, plodding downtrend, Singapore's housing market may be gathering forces for a rebound.

Sigrid Zialcita, managing director for Asia Pacific research at Cushman & Wakefield, told CNBC's "The Rundown" last week that she expected a turning point in prices "very soon."

She pointed to the government's recent move to ease some of its curbs on the sector as the reason for the market's changing fortunes.

"That actually boosted sentiment in the market. We've seen an increase in foot traffic and it's incentivizing a lot of buyers," she said.

Others also noted that the government's decision to loosen the reins may be spurring more property activity.

Hari Krishnan, CEO of website PropertyGuru, pointed to more optimism, with the number of property listings in the first quarter rising 2.0 percent on-year and 2.4 percent in March.

"These increases could be indicative of an uplift in seller sentiment," he said via email this week.

That hasn't been reflected in prices yet. In the first quarter, overall private home prices fell 0.5 percent on-quarter, the 14th straight quarter of declines. This time around, however, the bulk of the decline was in relatively small landed property segment, while non-landed prices were steady.

The city-state's housing prices surged more than 60 percent from 2009 through 2013, propelled by rock-bottom global interest rates and quantitative easing in developed economies, even as the government enacted a series of cooling measures from 2011 to prevent a bubble from forming.

The measures, including an Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty which could add as much as an additional 15 percent to the price, appeared to have eventually met with some success, with the property price index falling around 11 percent from the peak in the third quarter of 2013 through the end of 2016, according to data from Deutsche Bank in January.

Now, the government may have a more sanguine view, taking moves in early March to scale back some of the curbs, including lowering the seller's stamp duty and shortening the minimum holding period to avoid it.

Even amid trade tensions, Ford pushes pickup trucks in China

### TEXT: 
Liu Qipeng has a passion for rock climbing and camping, but for those activities, a Chinese-branded vehicle just won't do.

So even in this era of rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, Mr. Liu, 38, a chemicals recycling entrepreneur in southeastern China, chose to wait for the chance to buy what might be the most American of rides: a Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck imported from the United States.

"I like this model because it is very masculine and powerful," Mr. Liu said, adding that his friends "start to lean toward Ford when they plan to change their cars."

Trump and Warren Agree? Maybe, on Plan to Shrink Big Banks

Ford Motor is putting the premium version of the F-150 on sale on Saturday in a country where pickup trucks are virtually unheard-of except on farms. Detroit's automakers see a potential new world of Chinese drivers, who in recent years have embraced sport utility vehicles and want to drive bigger, beefier cars.

As President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China meet in Florida this week to address growing trade tensions, Ford's interest in sending American-made pickup trucks to China underlines the debate's complexities. Despite lopsided trade between the countries, Chinese consumers show a persistent and lucrative appetite for American brands.

Fords and Chevrolets — mostly made in China, but profitable either way for Detroit — are common sights on the streets. "They think American-brand vehicles are reliable, strong and tough," said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a consulting firm in Shanghai.

It goes beyond cars. Apple's iPhone has faced growing competition but remains a sign of affluence and success. Chinese consumers wear Nikes and buy lattes at Starbucks. For many buyers, the brands connote sophistication and an indication that they have made it.

Ford, which will import the pickups from Dearborn, Mich., is not alone. General Motors this year began to import Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup trucks from Flint, Mich., and the Chevrolet Colorado midsize pickup from Wentzville, Mo. Ford plans to start importing the Ford Ranger midsize pickup next year as well. Both have modest expectations compared with the United States, where nearly 2.7 million pickup trucks were sold last year, almost eight times as many as in China last year, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting firm.

For years, Chinese consumers saw pickup trucks as polluting rural rattletraps suitable only for bringing in produce from the farm. Pickups made in the country sell for as little as $7,000. Many provinces ban trucks, including pickups, from being driven in cities by day.

Interest in the cars began to grow early last year, when central government officials urged Chinese provinces to lighten restrictions on pickups as part of a broad plan to encourage consumption in the economy, including purchases of automobiles. Chinese-brand automakers had also called for a relaxation of the rules as a way to develop their pickup truck businesses.

Ford plans to introduce its "Built Ford Tough" marketing campaign in China this spring, said Peter Fleet, the company's vice president for marketing, sales and service in Asia and the Pacific. Its marketers experimented with various Mandarin translations of the phrase before concluding that the English version worked.

"The research came back resoundingly clear: No, we understand 'Built Ford Tough,'" Mr. Fleet said.

Cars are a particular sticking point between the United States and China because Beijing charges heavy taxes and duties on imported cars. While Ford has not released the official price for the Raptor, Mr. Liu said that he had been told it would be about $81,000. A similarly equipped Raptor sells for $50,000 in the United States. Chinese import and value-added taxes would make up most — but not all — of the difference.

The price could be even higher if Ford were importing cars from the United States instead of pickup trucks. China classifies pickup trucks as trucks and not as passenger vehicles, a category that in the country encompasses cars, sport utility vehicles and minivans. That truck classification exempts pickups from a Chinese consumption tax on passenger vehicles with large engines that can go as high as 40 percent.

Mr. Liu said that if he faced a consumption tax like that, he would not buy the Ford pickup.

"If it has a 20 percent tax, I wouldn't consider buying it, because one of the major motives for me to buy it is that it's a very cost-effective model," he said. "It's a toy for me after all, not a must-have."

China also exempts pickup trucks entirely from fuel economy averages. It sets a much higher corporate fuel-economy average — 38 miles per gallon — than the United States for all the cars, minivans and S.U.V.s that each automaker sells in the country.

This has forced manufacturers to design and sell models with engines that are much smaller and less powerful than in the United States but also more fuel efficient.

By contrast, Mr. Trump announced last month that he would roll back increases in American fuel economy averages that President Barack Obama had mandated.

Attitudes toward pickups are softening in parts of China. Ford said six provinces had exempted pickups from urban driving restrictions widely imposed on trucks in the country.

That liberalization could help the fight against air pollution. It could shift the mix of vehicles purchased by farmers away from heavily polluting tractors and toward pickups instead, said Hui He, a senior researcher in the San Francisco office of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research group based in Washington best known for its role in exposing Volkswagen's diesel emissions deception.

Mr. Liu lives in the southern city of Guangzhou, in Guangdong Province, which has not changed its rules. He said that while he owned other vehicles, he planned to drive his pickup around town sometimes as though it were a car and would see whether the police tried to stop him.

"As long as the local authorities don't ban me from driving it here," he said, "I'll drive it."

### TITLE: 
China's press has been relatively mute on the Trump-Xi summit—here's why

### TEXT: 
While American TV networks blast footage of the summit in Mar-a-Lago between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese media have been cautious.



Normally when Xi travels, especially on an overseas trip, there is a full-court press. For a trip to the U.S. to meet the leader of the free world, greater coverage would seem to be warranted. However, when the two presidents met in Florida during the early hours in China, there was almost no reporting at all. No photos of Xi. Discussions about the event appeared to be blocked and censored.



Only in the late afternoon hours Friday did the state media start to report more detail of the summit — though the articles have largely included only basic information. For example: Trump's acceptance of Xi's invitation to China.

People on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, have been mainly focused on the fashion of Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan and the handshake between the two presidents. "The handshake looks very gentle," one user wrote.



Zhang Ming, a political science professor at Renmin University, told CNBC the reason for the near radio silence is because the Chinese government is still nervous about what will come out of the Florida summit and how it could affect Xi's image back home. Chinese government officials are meticulous at planning events and tend to shy away from anything impromptu.



"Chinese people associate a leader's image with the ability to rule. If he doesn't have a good image, there will be trouble," Zhang explained. "Trump is very hard to predict, so there is a lot of uncertainty in this meeting."



There has been talk in China about how the U.S. airstrike on Syria could influence the Trump-Xi meeting and what it signals to the Chinese about North Korea. Trump has indicated he plans to push his Chinese counterpart to get tougher on Pyongyang, Beijing's longtime ally. North Korea, for its part, test-fired a ballistic missile ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.



At a regular press briefing in Beijing on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry called for calm and for all sides to "stick to political settlements." It also said China opposes the use of chemical weapons.

Zhang Lifan, a Chinese historian, speculated that another reason authorities overseeing the local media were so cautious Friday was because Xi could be potentially embarrassed if Trump gets tough with him on North Korea.

"Xi won't appear strong on this issue as he is always painted to be [by the government] and he won't want the people to see it," Zhang told CNBC. "This is why the state media is so low key reporting this meeting."

— CNBC's Daisy Cherry contributed to this report.

In France's version of America's Rust Belt, the steel mills have shut and voters are flocking to the far right

### TEXT: 
Forty kilometers south of the cosmopolitan metropolis of Lille lies the French city of Hénin-Beaumont. Surrounded by waste heaps from old mines it is home to more than 26,000 people.



Hénin-Beaumont forms part of a wider region where the closure of mines and steel plants has transformed life and drawn comparisons with America's Rust Belt. Once a prosperous region in the northeast of France, it has been hit by deindustrialization and unemployment – the jobless rate has reached about 17 percent when the national average is closer to 10 percent.

Historically, steelworkers and miners have tended to vote left, but in the past few years, the far-right Front National (FN) has managed to establish itself locally. Since 2014, the party holds two cities in this region, Hénin-Beaumont and another city called Hayange.



Hénin-Beaumont itself is taken as an example of the Front National's management skills. The mayor, Steeve Briois, is widely praised by inhabitants and it didn't take long walking around the town for CNBC to find his supporters.

"When he (Briois) arrived in 2014, it was the Socialist Party at the helm, and Hénin-Beaumont had a lot of difficulties, now Mr. Briois put things right … I say that the Front National is today able to do the same thing on a national level", said Daniel Vaissier, who moved to Hénin-Beaumont a few months ago, but already supports the mayor strongly.

Professor Richard Portes on EU-27 and UK outlook post-Brexit

### TEXT: 
We’re all going to be worse off post-Brexit: LBS professor Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 1:26 AM ET | 02:05

The U.K. and the rest of the European Union may want to come out of the Brexit negotiations on a positive note, but one leading London-based professor tells CNBC this may not be the case.

"Everybody wants win-win, everybody wants for (us to) all be better off. It's not going to be that way," Richard Portes, professor of economics at London Business School, told CNBC Friday.

"We're all going to be – both on the U.K. side and the EU-27 side – we're all going to be worse off. There's no way that you can avoid the shocks, the negative shocks that will come from breaking the past trade, investment and so forth relationships that we've had."

It's been just over a week since the U.K. triggered Article 50 and in the run-up to – and following the – triggering of formal exit talks, leading figures from both the U.K. and EU have stated that they want to keep close ties, with Eurogroup Chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem saying in Berlin Thursday, that both the U.K. and the rest of the EU should try to "minimize the damage" of Brexit, with him also highlighting the risks facing financial stability, Reuters reported.

On the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Finance Workshop in Italy, Portes discussed the economic outlook for Europe and the U.K., telling CNBC that while the euro area's economy has been picking up, troubles are expected ahead for the British economy.

"The outlook, interestingly, for the euro area economy has been picking up very substantially over the past half a year and that's partly to do with the European Central Bank's aggressive easing policies."

When it comes to the U.K., however, Portes believed the Bank of England would be facing its own set of challenges as the end of 2017 approaches.

"I think the Bank is going to be facing a hard choice towards the end of this year, because I think that consumer expenditure will be slowing down, investment will not be picking up and inflation will be picking up."

"So the bank will have the classic conflict between 'do we raise rates to combat inflation?' with the possibility that in fact that the economy is slowing down significantly."

### TITLE: 
Greece agrees to new reforms but date for fresh payments and discussion on debt is uncertain

### TEXT: 
The Greek government has agreed Friday to institute new measures worth of 2 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the decade – after the country exits its third bailout program.

However, there is no scheduled date for new payments to Athens, which raises doubts about Greece's ability to repay creditors in July. Furthermore, discussions on debt restructuring, which have yet to begin, are set to be complex and long.

Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Friday that there's been "significant progress" in talks with the Greek government after the latter agreed to legislate reforms affecting the country's pension system and widen the country's tax base.

Following Friday's Eurogroup agreement, it is now up to the Greek government to implement the pledged reforms and then technical teams will be able to conclude the second bailout review, an EU official told CNBC on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic.

Once that review is finalized, Greece will receive fresh disbursements from the 86 billion euro ($91.40 billion) bailout program.

"We don't know dates for disbursements," the official said. It all depends on how quickly Greece legislates the new reform package.

Analysts have said that Greece will struggle to repay 8 billion euros ($8.51 billion) it owes governments and private investors due next July without new money coming in.

"My guess is that the Greek government got a stern warning from the ECB(European Central Bank)/Bank of Greece that a further impasse would have meant a severe hit to the economy via capital outflows," Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNBC via email about Friday's agreement.

"We have to be skeptical of course that a reform pledge for 2019 and 2020 will actually be carried out, but it plugs a hole for now," he added.

But the big hurdle in Greek bailout talks comes after the conclusion of the review, assuming that Athens follows through with the pledged commitments.

"We will start discussing the Greek debt, and that's going to be a very complicated discussion," the official said.

The International Monetary Fund has said that before it joins the Greek bailout, the country's debt need to be more manageable. At the same time, European creditors want the IMF involved in the Greek process to give credibility to the program.

This has been a contentious issue between Greece's euro creditors, Greece and the IMF since the program began. This is because there's been strong opposition from European countries to grant signifcant debt relief before the program concludes in 2018.

The IMF has already agreed that debt relief can be applied after 2018, but it will conduct a new debt sustainability analysis to ensure that the reforms agreed so far will reduce Greece's debt. If that's the case, the Fund will join the bailout financially.

"As for the IMF, I would assume that they are in … otherwise I don't see the Eurogroup agreeing to this. Another way to put it is that they haven't said, as far as I can see at least, that they're out. So I have to assume that they're in," Pantheon's Vistesen said about the IMF's participation.

Yvan Mamalet, senior euro area economist at Societe Generale, told CNBC in January that it would be "very difficult" for Greece to go back to the markets once the program is concluded and fund itself at low costs if it hasn't lowered its debt levels.

### summary: 
Once that review is finalized, Greece will receive fresh disbursements from the 86 billion euro ($91.40 billion) bailout program.
But the big hurdle in Greek bailout talks comes after the conclusion of the review, assuming that Athens follows through with the pledged commitments.
"We will start discussing the Greek debt, and that's going to be a very complicated discussion," the official said.
The International Monetary Fund has said that before it joins the Greek bailout, the country's debt need to be more manageable.

Samsung trial begin with boss Jay Y Lee silent in first court appearance

### TEXT: 
"The defendant, Jay Y. Lee, didn't even know that the contribution was made, because that's not part of his job," his lawyer, Song Wu-cheol, told the court. Lee had merely relayed the comments from one-on-one meetings with Park to his top lieutenant, Choi Gee-sung, he added.

Choi, a former Samsung Group vice chairman considered a mentor to Jay Y. Lee, left the conglomerate on March 1 after it dismantled its corporate strategy office - a nerve center long considered an instrument for the founding Lee family's management of the companies.

Clad in white shirt and gray suit, Lee, himself the vice chairman of Samsung

Electronics Co Ltd, was mostly expressionless. He nodded when one of

his attorneys reiterated his previous denials of having paid bribes.

Beyond confirming personal details such as his name and occupation, Lee

remained silent when the judge asked if he had anything to say in response to

the charges he faces.

Lee's lawyers said the Samsung boss made financial payments in response to

requests by then-President Park and sought no favors in return.

The leader of the smartphones-to-biopharmaceuticals business empire is the only founding family member among the country's most powerful conglomerates, called chaebol, to be indicted in a graft scandal that led to Park becoming South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office.

Park herself was arrested last week on charges such as colluding with Choi to pressure businesses such as Samsung to contribute to foundations that backed her administration's policy initiatives.

But the special prosecution says Samsung's Lee actively curried Park's favor to cement his control of the family business empire.

"We have secured enough evidence proving that defendant Lee Jae-yong made improper requests to the president," said Park Young-soo, the special prosecutor, referring to the Samsung leader by his Korean name.

Lee sought Park's help in maximizing his control of the Samsung companies at

the lowest possible cost, he added.

Why Xi's visit to Trump's Florida estate could spark Mar-a-Lago mania

### TEXT: 
Xi's visit, he said, sends a strong message to China's domestic audience that Mar-a-Lago is a "wonderful" destination in which they should have confidence.

"Historically, Los Angeles and New York have been the mainstays of (Chinese) demand," Pittar said, adding that Florida is quickly taking the spotlight, spurring on a Mar-a-Lago mania.

Juwai.com's database, which calculates the number of inquiries as buyer interest, shows a 62.5 percent jump of Florida property inquiries from Chinese buyers in 2016 compared to 2015, and a 48 percent rise from 2014 to 2015.

With its sun, sand, sea and sprawling golf courses, it's perhaps little surprise that the Chinese are flocking to the Sunshine State. Other triggers for the spike in Chinese demand include the possible upcoming direct flights between Florida and China, and the boost of confidence within the community when Chinese developers start building at a particular location, Pittar told CNBC's "Squawk Box."

Qantas fires first shot in battle for Australia's domestic market

### TEXT: 
Qantas has flicked the switch on its domestic in-flight Wi-Fi offering — the latest innovation aimed at snaring more of Australia's competitive domestic market.

Over the next 18 months the nation's flag carrier will roll out Wi-Fi on its entire domestic fleet, enabling downloads once the aircraft door has closed.

Speaking with CNBC at a media launch for the Wi-Fi offering, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said intense competition in the domestic market has prompted new initiatives.

"We always want to stay ahead... offering Wi-Fi for free enhances our advantage over the competition. If you're ahead, stay ahead," Joyce said.

Qantas is planning on large usage by customers once the service is rolled out on the network.

"We think 50 to 60 percent of passengers will use the service because it's going to be free," Joyce explained.

Qantas unsuccessfully trialed a Wi-Fi offering on some of its international fleet, but pulled the trial after a lukewarm response and unreliable service.

The airline isn't planning on such issues on the roll out across its domestic network.

"This is the first time we're able to offer a very high speed service and consistent product across Australia because the national broadband network have launched two satellites that cover the entire continent," Joyce told CNBC.

Domestic rival Virgin Australia will launch a similar Wi-Fi offering toward the middle of 2017 as on-board technology offerings firm up as the next battleground in the Australian domestic market.

Trader poll: Where can President Trump and President Xi make most progress?

### TEXT: 
The long-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is finally set to take place this Thursday to Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.

However, it is not without a build-up of tension. Just last Friday, Trump said the meeting with China "will be a very difficult one" because the U.S. will no longer tolerate "massive trade deficits and job losses."



The 45th President of the United States also said to the Financial Times that the U.S. will act unilaterally if China does not pressure Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions.



"China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't," Trump told the FT.

Earlier in December, Trump angered Beijing by talking to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and saying the the U.S. did not need to keep to the One China policy. But later in February, Trump in a phone call with Xi agreed to honor the policy which states that there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of it.



Aside from trade, North Korea and the One China policy, the two leaders of the world's largest economies are expected to discuss currencies and the South China Sea.

Trader poll: Which will garner the most market attention?

### TEXT: 
With the economic data calendar looking light this week, other factors are eyed for market attention.

U.S. President Donald Trump suffered a legislative defeat last Friday when Republicans pulled a bill to overhaul Obamacare, which was one of his major 2016 election campaign promises.

Across the Atlantic Ocean, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is set to trigger Article 50 on March 29, which will formally kick start the process of Britain's divorce from the European Union.

At the weekend, a joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to review whether the global pact to curb supply should be extended. But some analysts said that the lack of an immediate extension could weigh on crude oil prices, Reuters reported.

A series of central bank officials are also set to speak over the week, from the Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen to the European Central Bank's Benoit Coeure.

With U.S. stock markets posting their worst week since the election and the VIX still languishing in the low double-digits, which of these will garner the most attention from market participants?

These are the 10 most effective advertising campaigns in the world

### TEXT: 
A commercial encouraging men in India to do their fair share of household chores has become the world's most effective advert, according to a study.

"Share the Load," an ad for laundry brand Ariel, resulted in doubled sales by value and by volume, the study by advertising research company WARC said. More than 1.5 million men in India also pledged to do their fair share of housework.

Procter and Gamble, which owns Ariel, is the world's number one advertiser, according to WARC, with five advertising campaigns in a list of the top 100.

Other adverts that made it into the top ten include a subscription campaign for The Economist by agency Proximity London, which had a return on investment of 25 to one, and a series of ads for Australian swimming pool company Narellan, which used data to target people at times when they were most likely to buy a pool resulting in a 23 percent sales uplift. Other winners include Apple, Always and U.K. department store John Lewis.

WARC put the list together by analyzing more than 2,000 winners of advertising effectiveness campaigns around the world, in partnership with King's College London.

Here the ten most effective advertising campaigns globally, according to WARC.

1. Ariel "Share the Load," India

A father in India looks on as his daughter returns from work. Her son needs a clean shirt, her husband demands his dinner and her living room needs tidying. Ariel wanted the ad to encourage fathers to help with household chores - and of course sell detergent.

Huge wind turbines are to combine with hydropower in a German forest

In Germany, two renewable energy sources are being combined in a novel project looking to break new ground and transform the scenery of a German forest.



GE, through GE Renewable Energy, has signed an agreement with Max Bögl Wind AG to both deliver and commission what it has described as "the world's tallest and first ever wind turbine integrated with pumped storage hydro-electric power."

In and of themselves, wind and hydro are becoming increasingly important sources of power. The International Energy Agency (IEA), for example, describes hydropower as "the largest single renewable electricity source today." Wind energy, it states, is moving towards becoming a "mainstream, competitive and reliable power technology."

The scale of the project GE is involved in, which is based in the Swabian-Franconian Forest in Germany, is considerable.



The wind turbine towers used in the project will have a "total tip height" of 246.5 meters, with each tower's base and surrounding area used as a water reservoir.

Climate change could increase severe turbulence by 149 percent, study says

### TEXT: 
Turbulence can be an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience. And climate change is about to make it an increasingly common one, according to a new study.



Using supercomputer simulations of the atmosphere, researchers at the University of Reading, in England, looked at the future of severe turbulence.



They focused on how wintertime transatlantic clear-air turbulence would change at around 39,000 feet if the atmosphere contained twice as much CO2.



The study found that the average amount of light turbulence in the atmosphere would rise by 59 percent, while light-to-moderate turbulence would increase by 75 percent.



At the other end of the scale, moderate-to-severe turbulence would increase by 127 percent, while severe turbulence would increase by 149 percent.

Large and abrupt changes in altitude and attitude, as well as a large variation in indicated airspeed, characterize severe turbulence, according Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. In addition, the aircraft "may be temporarily out of control."

"Our new study paints the most detailed picture yet of how aircraft turbulence will respond to climate change," Paul Williams, who undertook the research, said in a statement.

"For most passengers, light turbulence is nothing more than an annoying inconvenience that reduces their comfort levels, but for nervous fliers even light turbulence can be distressing," Williams added.

"However, even the most seasoned frequent fliers may be alarmed at the prospect of a 149% increase in severe turbulence, which frequently hospitalizes air travelers and flight attendants around the world."

The study was published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.

How one power plant is turning away from coal to embrace wood pellets and straw

### TEXT: 
Something of a biomass revolution is taking place in Denmark. Earlier this year Danish energy company, DONG Energy, announced it would stop "all use of coal" by 2023 and look to focus on sustainable biomass instead.

At the Avedøre Power Station, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, a transformation has taken place: between 2015 and 2016 Avedøre 1, one of its power station units, was converted to use wood pellets rather than coal.



The Avedøre 2 unit uses natural gas, oil, straw and wood pellets. DONG Energy says the biomass system has a capacity of 45 megawatts and is able to take 25 tonnes of straw every hour.

Today, according to DONG Energy, the Avedøre facility is "able to run 100 percent on sustainable biomass."

The impact on the environment is being keenly felt.



"When we look at the life cycle assessment of the green energy that we are using, the wood pellets and the straw, we are reducing the CO2 emissions by approximately 90 percent compared to when we were using coal," Ole Thomsen, senior vice president at Avedøre Power Station, told CNBC's Sustainable Energy.



Thomsen went on to explain that most of the biomass being used was sourced from Baltic countries that are home to a big timber industry.



While the environmental benefits may be clear, cost was still something to be considered, although legislation is helping to smooth the transition.

"Coal is still a cheaper fuel than wood pellets," Thomsen said. "But when you're using coal for heat production there is a CO2 tax on it, when you're using wood pellets for heat production there is no CO2 tax."



"All in all, this means that we are able to produce green energy for the same price for the customer as when we were using coal."

The leaner, greener LNG carrier of the future

### TEXT: 
Gas is enjoying soaring growth. Plentiful and comparatively low carbon, it is expected to make up an increasingly large share of the global energy mix in 2050. As a result, its transportation is scaling up too. Never have so many LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers crisscrossed the planet's seas. But, shipping still accounts for a big chunk of the final cost of a cubic meter of gas — too big, in fact. Both to whittle that down and for environmental reasons, Total has designed and begun construction of two LNG carriers offering improved energy efficiency, in large part because they will use some of the gas they carry for their own needs. Jacques Besse, vice president of LNG shipping at Total, explains the challenges and potential of these LNG carriers of the future.

There are two ways to move gas. One is by land, via gas pipelines; the other is by sea, aboard LNG carriers. Maritime shipping accounts for more than 31 percent of all the natural gas transported in the world1 and is expanding fast for two main reasons. The first is that major producing regions2 are located far from consumer markets.3 The second is that shipping is more flexible, making it easier to balance supply and demand. Geopolitical considerations and the advantage of reliably safe carriers are other key factors.

Natural gas must be liquefied before it can be shipped: In this way, 600 cubic meters of natural gas can be reduced to 1 cubic meter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). It's a four-step process, from purification, which removes carbon dioxide and sulfur compounds, to liquefaction, which cools the gas to -161 degrees Celsius at atmospheric pressure. The LNG is then ready to be loaded onto LNG carriers.

Okta CEO says it’s a ‘good environment’ for an IPO as tech firm starts trading on the Nasdaq

### TEXT: 
It was an "inevitable" step for Okta to go public in what is a "good environment" for technology initial public offerings, the chief executive of the identity management firm told CNBC on Friday.

Okta is raising $187 million in an IPO on the Nasdaq Friday, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. Okta priced its shares at $17 apiece, on the upper end of the range and begins trading when the markets open on Friday.

The company specializes in identity management software. As companies scale, some employees will need access to certain applications in the cloud while others won't do. So Okta manages who gets access to what with the aim of preventing security breaches.

The company has so far raised $228.5 million in venture funding, according to Crunchbase data, and Okta CEO Todd McKinnon said it was the right time for the company to go public.

"We started out to build a large important technology company and this is inevitably a step along the way for companies that have that goal," McKinnon told CNBC Friday.

"The first time you take venture funding, going public is inevitable

and we felt the timing was right and this was a good environment," he added.

The firm's entrance onto the public market continues the trend of tech companies carrying out an IPO after a slow 2016. Snap Inc, the biggest tech IPO this year, popped on its debut in March, but has since had a roller-coaster ride and its shares are trading below the price when it first hit the markets. There appears to be a strong pipeline of companies too. Last month, Cloudera filed for an IPO.

But Okta could face competition from established players such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Okta's CEO said, however, that the company can work with all of these cloud providers.

Google expands ‘Fact Check’ tool to flag up fake news in search results

### TEXT: 
In October, Google tested the feature in a handful of countries and specifically in Google News. The announcement on Friday marks the wide-scale roll out of the feature.

The information won't be available for every search, Google said, and there could be instances where the same publisher checked the same claim but came to different conclusions. Google emphasized the fact that it was not checking the facts and are "presented so people can make more informed judgments."

"Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree," Google explained in a blog post.

Publishers wishing to be included in the fact check feature just need to add some additional code to their websites.

Google's move comes amid heightened criticism of internet companies' inability to tackle fake news and misinformation. Google has been one of the companies under fire and has been making moves to improve how it tackles such content.

Social networking titan Facebook has also taken steps to tackle fake news content including its own fact checking tool which tells users who are about to post a link to an article, whether the claims in the article have been disputed. Facebook also launched an educational tool to help users spot questionable content.

Adidas is going to sell 100,000 sneakers with 3-D printed soles

### TEXT: 
Sneakers are traditionally made with an injection mold allowing companies to make them on a large scale. Carbon claims that its method known as "Digital Light Synthesis" will allow Adidas to get the scale for the shoe. The process works by using light to shape a liquid resin which is then heated to become solid.

Adidas said it analyzed a library of running data to come up with the perfect design for the sole. While Adidas is making one design of the shoe, it paves the way in the future for the company to tailor-make individual shoes to a specific person.

"Digital Light Synthesis allows Adidas to precisely address the needs of each athlete in regards to movement, cushioning, stability, and comfort with one single component," a press release issued by Carbon on Friday said.

Adidas did not say how much the sneaker would cost.

It's not the first time Adidas has experimented with 3-D printing. It began experimenting with the technology in 2015 and last year released a limited edition $333 sneaker called the 3-D Runner.

Rivals are also jumping onto the technology. Last year Nike struck a partnership with HP Inc to accelerate the prototyping and eventual manufacturing of 3-D printed clothing and footwear.

Wendy’s promised a man a year’s supply of free chicken nuggets if he gets 18 million retweets

### TEXT: 
Technology and the internet can sometimes be a wonderful thing. Take the case of Carter Wilkerson, a man from Reno, Nevada, who took to Twitter and asked fast food chain Wendy's how many retweets he would need for a year of free chicken nuggets.

And to his surprise Wendy's replied saying that 18 million retweets were required. "Consider it done," Wilkerson replied.

It's a near impossible feat when put into context. The most retweeted tweet ever was Ellen Degeneres' selfie at the Oscars in 2014 with loads of celebrities.

Twitter says it has 319 million daily active users. For Wilkerson to reach his 18 million target, it would require 5.6 percent of the Twitter user base to retweet him, which might give some hope.

There were no details on what a year's supply would entail – whether that means unlimited nuggets per day or a set amount.

Wilkerson has garnered support online and his tweet has racked up over 837,000 retweets since being posted on Thursday.

Wendy's is fairly active on Twitter but while it has been praised for its social media tactics in the past, it has also landed the food chain in trouble. The company tweeted out an image which was associated with white nationalists earlier this year, then quickly removed it.

This is the next subprime fear worrying investors

### TEXT: 
While the global economy may still be dealing with the after-effects of the financial crisis of 2008, the latest subprime fear in the auto industry has already started to worry investors.

In a note last week, UBS analysts Matthew Mish and Stephen Caprio said the latest subprime auto default data has been more than raising eyebrows in financial circles and the wider economy. While many analysts have been trying to explain subprime default rates for recent vintages that have reached levels just prior to the financial crisis of 2008, a number of U.S. banks have predicted consumers and auto delinquencies to rise further in 2017.

Another report from Morgan Stanley recently described a third of the risky loans bundled into bonds as "deep subprime". The report said that this level has spiked since 2010 and is now slowly translating to higher delinquencies on loans. And the securitization market has become more heavily weighted towards issuers that would consider deep subprime.

"The percentage of subprime auto-loan securitizations considered deep subprime has risen to 32.5 percent from 5.1 percent since 2010," Morgan Stanley said. "Auto loan fundamental performance, especially within ABS pools, continues to deteriorate."

Every tech IPO filing uses the same word to describe Silicon Valley hiring: 'intense'

### TEXT: 
Okta's successful IPO on Friday marked another win for San Francisco's technology industry, which has exploded in the past decade with new software and internet companies.

But Okta's location is a blessing and a curse.

Buried in the risks section of the software developer's prospectus is language that now shows up in every IPO filing for Bay Area companies.

The non-legal version would say something like: "engineers around here are expensive and flaky."

Here's the actual wording:

"Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software" as well as for salespeople.

Intense is the word of choice.

Cloudera, which sells software for big data projects, is the next notable name on the IPO docket. The company, based in Palo Alto and with an office in San Francisco, said "competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence."

How about MuleSoft? The provider of a platform for connecting applications went public last month. MuleSoft told investors that, "competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located."

### TITLE: 
Here's why one tech investor thinks some doctors will be 'obsolete' in five years

### TEXT: 
Vinod Khosla once proclaimed that machines will replace 80 percent of doctors, which prompted waves of backlash from the medical community.

Never one to shy away from controversy, the venture capitalist went a step further when I interviewed him last month for a podcast hosted by Silicon Valley biotechnology startup Color Genomics. "The role of the radiologist will be obsolete in five years," he said.

In Khosla's view, sophisticated algorithms are better than specialists at spotting potential problems in medical images, like x-rays and CT scans. "There's no reason a human should be doing it," he says, adding that computers can rapidly shift through thousands of scans to evaluate possible diagnoses and potential treatments, as well as ingest the latest medical research.

The podcast will go live on Monday.

A report from PwC found that about 4 in 10 U.S. jobs are susceptible being taken over by machines in the next 15 years. But doctors don't typically make the list of the occupations most under threat, given the importance of bedside manner, among other factors.

Khosla's comments come at a time when many of the leading technology companies are building new tools for the medical sector.

Technology companies, including Alphabet, have efforts underway to train machines to spot potential problems in medical scans. Verily, Alphabet's health and life sciences arm, recently teamed up with Nikon to develop machine learning tools to screen for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, both causes of blindness in people with diabetes.

In 2015, Kaggle (later acquired by Google), hosted a competition for data scientists to develop a similar algorithm, with the winner having an "agreement rate" about 10 percent higher than a human specialist. What that means is that the algorithm and human were more likely to agree on a diagnosis than two human experts. IBM Watson is also developing tools to help physicians solve medical mysteries by shifting through millions of research papers in minutes.

Still, many of these efforts aim to augment doctors, and not replace them.

The goal for Kaggle's algorithm, for instance, was to help radiologists triage, so they can prioritize certain patients over others in giant piles of scans.

Radiologists say their jobs will only become more important in the coming years.

The specialty is a prime target for tech companies, as radiologists have used computer-assisted tools for years. "Our field is the Silicon Valley of medicine," says Garry Choy, a San Francisco-based radiologist, adding that computers would free up time for radiologists to "do what humans do best," rather than take their jobs. That includes more time with patients, and "higher order complex thinking," he added.

Others, like Simon Rascovsky, a radiologist and director of medical informatics at medical software startup Nucleus Health, have heard statements like this before, given all the hype around artificial intelligence. But he said that the radiology field still doesn't have "clinically proven deep learning based applications outside of pilots and marketing hype."

Snapchat just made applying for a job at McDonald's easier for millennials

### TEXT: 
Teens looking for a job at McDonald's need only a smartphone and 10 seconds to apply for a position thanks to Snapchat.

The Australian arm of the burger chain is testing out a new way to hire young people using the popular social media app, according to a report by news.com.au, an Australian news website.

Applicants can try on a virtual McDonald's uniform and pitch their skills in a 10-second video. Once the company reviews the Snapchat application, or "snaplication," it will send users to its digital career site where they can download an application form.

"We think this is actually a world first," Shaun Ruming , chief operating officer of McDonald's Australia, told news.com.au. "We're the largest employer of youth in the country, so we're trying to look for new and innovative ways to recruit crew people."

According to the report, 65 percent of the Australian McDonald's employees are under the age of 18.

Of course, the Snapchat video won't entirely replace McDonald's traditional hiring process, but it will be taken into account.

"We're looking for that positivity, bubbly personality, someone we think would be good in a customer service role," Ruming said.

### TITLE: 
The 'Trump rally' is on its last legs — here’s what that means for the market

### TEXT: 
The "Trump trade" narrative is dying in the stock market.

The election of President Donald Trump and a Republican-majority in Congress was supposed to lead to Obamacare's end, tax reform, deregulation, an infrastructure build-out and a healthy increase in inflation accompanied by a rise in long-depressed interest rates.

But after the failure of Trump's Obamacare replacement at the end of last month followed by a weaker-than-expected jobs report Friday, the market clearly has its doubts about this premise.

Let's take the Trump trade point by point and see where it stands in the market's eyes.

1. Health-care reform — market saying, "Not likely"

On March 24, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump pulled the Republican bill after failing to win votes from the farther-right faction of the party. But Ryan was back this week proposing a new version of the bill that addresses persons with pre-existing conditions.

Does the market think he has a chance?

Take a look at a chart of Universal Health Services, an operator of acute care and behavioral health facilities which makes it among the most vulnerable health-care stocks if Obamacare goes away and a more strict Republican plan wins.

The stock has steadily climbed back to near where it was before the election. It would be going down if investors thought the Republicans had a chance.

2. Reflation — market saying, "Maybe"

The 10-year Treasury yield is back to levels not seen since just after Trump was elected. The decline has occurred even after the Fed raised rates last month. If investors really believed that Trump's plans are happening and that they will unleash a second-half economic growth boom, investors would be selling Treasurys and boosting that yield.

3. Infrastructure plan — market saying, "Maybe"

The market got excited a bit last week when it was reported Trump may be moving up his infrastructure plans and linking them to tax reform. But other than referencing this week a strange flow chart describing the process for getting a government building project approved, he has said little in detail about the plan, which officials have said will total $1 trillion.

If investors thought infrastructure was happening this chart of Martin Marietta, a maker of heavy building materials, would be pointing higher, but instead it has been stalling since January.

4. Tax reform — Market saying, "Maybe"

After the health-care debacle, investors are starting to doubt whether tax reform will happen in this year or at all. It didn't help when Ryan said this week that the two chambers of Congress and the White House are currently farther apart on tax reform than they were initially on the health-care plan that ultimately failed.

Still, many investors believe Trump and Congress can mess up many parts of tax reform as long as they get the part right about lowering the repatriation tax for companies with big stashes of foreign profits overseas.

Strategas Research Partners is keeping a great list of the companies that stand to benefit the most from a repatriation tax because of the amount of foreign cash they have relative to their market capitalization. The mock portfolio is still up since the election but the chart below shows that it is in a serious downtrend and back to levels where it started the year.

Source: Strategas Research Partners

It shows doubt that even a repatriation tax break can get done.

5. Deregulation — market saying, "Probably"

No one will benefit more from possible financial deregulation than the regional banks, who have had to devote a significant part of their relatively smaller resources to compliance. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF is still up big since the election, but it is well off the all-time high reached at the end of last month.

And as far that wall on the border with Mexico? Even the Mexican Peso has given up most of its losses since the election. (Chart below is the U.S. dollar vs the MXN, so lower value means peso gaining in value.)

So that's where we are as far as the "Trump trade" is concerned.

So where are we headed?

The catch is that the Trump trade can fail and the market can still do OK if one thing happens: earnings grow.

"The combination of planned tax cuts (both corporate and personal), light-handed regulation, a repatriation tax holiday on overseas cash and possible infrastructure spending has buoyed hopes for faster economic activity in 2H17 into 2018. However, earnings have been more crucial for stock prices," wrote Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist, in a note to clients Friday.

First-quarter earnings season kicks of with the major banks on Thursday. Right now, analysts expect the S&P 500 to post 9.9 percent earnings growth for the period, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Citigroup predicts 9 percent earnings growth for the full year, but admits a portion of that is banking on lower tax rates coming in the fourth quarter. That kind of earnings growth will justify the trailing P/E of 22 currently for the index, which is above a five-year average of 18.

Bottom line: If we get this kind of earnings growth, it validates the market at current levels, but for stocks to keep going the president needs to revive the Trump trade by taking action that indicates that at least tax reform is on the way before the year is out.

Cramer tracks 'the bid underneath' to explain why the market rallies on bad news

### TEXT: 
Or take Apple sound system play Cirrus Logic, which cut its guidance in its last earnings report but has been "a straight line up" since March began, in Cramer's words.

What baffles the "Mad Money" host is that the move is unfounded, or at least not based on any positive news in the semiconductor space that would fuel a typical rally.

No sellers have emerged even amid the downpour of usually market-rattling reports, so those tired of waiting for their favorite stocks to come down have finally given in and bought up.

"It's just that some portfolio managers just have been waiting and waiting and waiting for these stocks to come down, bidding underneath, as we say on the trading desk, and they aren't being hit, and they can't take it any more so they're reaching for all of them at once," Cramer said.

And the semiconductors aren't the only ones with hidden bids, according to Cramer. He has spotted bids underneath in the housing stocks, railroad plays, and supermarket names like Kroger and Whole Foods.

"The bid underneath, and the reach, are classic components of a true bull market," Cramer said. "Another reason why this market, for all its flaws, is a lot more resilient than it looks to the naked eye."

With the market unexpectedly maintaining its strength in light of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, President Donald Trump's tense meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and a weak jobs report, Jim Cramer looked for how glimmers of positivity emerged from the noise.

First, the "Mad Money" host noted that the market prefers decisiveness to uncertainty, hence the positive response to Trump denouncing the use of chemical weapons and taking action.

Cramer attributed the soft response to the Labor Department's employment report to bad weather marring construction hiring and a newfound understanding that lost retail jobs are not because of slowing consumer spending, but Amazon's growing influence.

Finally, oil prices spiked on inflamed tensions in the Middle East. "I know it's counter intuitive to like higher rates and higher oil prices but these are signs, at least to some market participants, that the economy is still strong even as last month's hiring seems disappointing," Cramer said.

With the market's resilience in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week:

Monday: Oil, rates, takeovers

The bulls are itching to see oil break out of its $47 to $52 range into the $53 to $54 area, and would also do well to see the 10-year Treasury's rates rise from 2.3 percent up to 2.4 or 2.5 percent.

Cramer also expects some takeover action in the biotechnology, consumer packaged goods, and oils sectors.

"I believe there are several European drug companies desperate to expand their pipelines and I expect them to start making deals in the near future. We know Kraft-Heinz is ready to pull the trigger on a deal, [but] we don't know who it's going to be," he said. "And the amount of call option buying in the major independent oils with Permian exposure this week, it was extraordinary."

Tuesday: PMIs

Purchasing Managers' indices from China and the United Kingdom concern Cramer, because if China's is weak, leaders there could insist on stimulus via U.S. business involvement.

"That would be a sign that the Trump meetings with the Chinese president this week went very well," he said.

But post-Brexit inflation in the United Kingdom could push the country's central bank to raise rates, an effect that could spark worries going forward.

Wednesday: Mortgage applications, Delta, Mosaic

Mortgage applications: "We need to see some proof that April's started off better than March finished," Cramer said, and the first good indicator will come from mortgage application data.

"Have these new lows that we've seen in rates ... spurred any buying? Is the spring selling season, so important for housing, starting strongly? I think this number, actually, strangely, is going to be the most important number about what's going on right now in the economy," the "Mad Money" host said.

Delta: The airliner reports earnings ahead of market open, and Cramer is worried about the effects of a slowdown in travel, though he does not expect any major bombshells.

"Either way, I want you to keep in mind that Warren Buffett owns 8% of this airline's stock, and I generally like buying a Buffett stock if I can get it on weakness," Cramer said.

Mosaic: An analyst meeting at the fertilizer company, and Cramer expects a strong story and says some upgrades for the lagging agriculture play are possible.

"I would actually like to own the stock ahead of that meeting," Cramer said.

Thursday: Big banks, small banks, Taiwan Semiconductor

JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo will report earnings in the morning, and Cramer is paying attention to net interest margins, or the "free money" banks make from deposits, loan growth, which he hopes has not slowed from the first quarter, and expenses in the midst of regulatory rollbacks.

In the case of Wells Fargo, Cramer hopes to gauge whether the bank has evaded the cross-selling scandal for good.

Cramer is also watching smaller banks PNC and First Horizon, as the companies' earnings could reveal whether commercial construction has slowed due to recent impasses in Washington.

Taiwan Semiconductor: If the chipmaker's earnings report shows that $171 billion company is spending, Cramer says investors should pick up shares of Lam Research or Applied Materials, as they will be the direct beneficiaries of Taiwan Semiconductor's capital outflows.

Markets are closed on Good Friday, so Cramer suggests taking a breath before earnings season really kicks into gear the following week.

"[The] bottom line is that the average just keep staying resilient, and if you stick around, I'll explain the itchy fingers that may very well be behind this market's seeming inability to crater even when you expect it to just plain get obliterated," Cramer said.

### TITLE: 
We have to connect the dots between students and jobs—commentary

### TEXT: 
"When states keep academic standards high, they're helping to put all students on a path to employment."

The demands of our workforce make standing by and continuing to build on a commitment to higher academic standards made by 42 states and the District of Columbia absolutely key to continued economic growth and low unemployment in the United States.

According to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, by 2020, 65 percent of all jobs in the economy will require post-secondary education and training beyond high school.

If we want to fill these jobs and reduce unemployment, we have to prepare today's students with the education and skills that will help prepare them for college and career.

And when students can see the connection between school and the colleges and careers they aspire to, they are more likely to stay in school. Delaware adopted higher academic standards in 2010, and thanks to the hard work of educators and students, the statewide graduation rate in 2016 reached 84.66 percent—the highest rate since 2010-11.

By creating stronger pathways between K-12, higher education, and the employer community—like discussed in this week's Business Town Hall—students are more prepared to gain college-entry credits or earn industry certifications while still in high school. For instance, in Delaware, our Pathways to Prosperity program saw enrollment grow from a few dozen students to more than 5,000 students who are now better prepared for college or career.

More rigorous academic standards can also help students prepare for competitive jobs in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields, where unemployment is more than two percentage points below the national average.

Unfortunately, the so-called "skills gap" between what employers need and employees can do is real, and growing—with nearly 95 percent of CEOs reporting that this talent gap, from entry level to highly technical positions, is problematic for their companies. That's why we need to remain committed to providing our students with the skills and knowledge they'll need to fill these jobs.

Today, 7 years after many states adopted higher academic standards, we've seen the majority of those states remain committed to implementing rigorous, comparable standards that better prepare students to think critically and problem solve.

We've also seen these states adopt assessments that are aligned to the new standards—assessments that provide a much clearer picture of where students are doing well and where they need additional support.

Students across the country are now beginning their third year of annual assessments aligned to the new standards, and we've seen scores on the rise for the majority of students—even as the nation's high-school graduation rate reached 83 percent in 2014-15, the fifth straight record-setting year.

From my vantage point, the correlation is clear: More rigorous academic standards that are better aligned to the skills and competencies of today's workplace—and the workplace of tomorrow—lead to more engaged students better equipped for postsecondary education, to better qualified job applicants, to lower unemployment, and to a stronger economy.

Now isn't the time to turn back this progress. When states keep academic standards high, they're helping to put all students on a path to employment. That's a smart investment for all our futures.

### TITLE: 
Trump’s foreign policy is dangerously impulsive-commentary

### TEXT: 
The cruise missile strikes President Donald Trump launched in reprisal for Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapon attack in Syria are well within the norms of American foreign policy. But they fall far outside the stated boundaries of Trump's foreign policy, and reflect an administration bereft of a consistent, considered approach to the world — an approach that would make America's actions predictable to both our friends and enemies, and guide the commitments we're willing to make in the event of escalation or reprisal.

What we are seeing, instead, is a foreign policy based on Trump's gut reactions to the images flashing before him on cable news. And that's dangerous.

Last week, despite Assad's horrific, ongoing slaughter of his own people, the Trump administration was comfortable seeing him retain power. In March, Nikki Haley, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said, "Our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out."

More from Vox:

Here's how leaders around the world are responding to the strike on Syria

West Virginia is legalizing medical marijuana — and it could help deal with its huge opioid crisis

Is 100% renewable energy realistic? Here's what we know

This was consistent with Trump's long-held view on Syria, which was that America should stay the hell away. Unlike many Republicans, his criticism of President Barack Obama wasn't for failing to follow through on infamous "red line" comments but for making them at all:

There was no ambiguity in Trump's position:

It was really unmistakable:

What changed Trump's mind was Assad's gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which killed at least 85 people, including 16 women and 23 children, and wounded at least 350 more. This was similar to the horrible chemical weapon attacks that crossed Obama's red line, and Trump even harked back to Obama's language in denouncing it.

"It crossed a lot of lines for me," the president told reporters on Wednesday. "When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal, people were shocked to hear what gas it was, that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines."

On this, Trump is, of course, right — Assad has crossed all the lines there are to cross. He is a monster, and the suffering he has unleashed is unimaginable. But that was true in 2013, too. Then, Trump said attacking Syria would mean "MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!" What has changed now? Will fewer bad things happen? Will the US get more? Trump has been emotionally moved by the images out of Syria, but what is his new policy meant to achieve? Does he even know?

As far as anyone can tell, Trump's strikes are motivated by his horror over the gassing of Syrian innocents. But the chemical weapons Assad has launched account for a tiny fraction of the horrors he has visited upon his country. If Trump is truly worried about the innocent babies, then much more needs to be done to protect them from bombs, from bullets, from fires, from starvation. Is he willing to do any of it?

How about the simplest, but most effective, thing we could do to save Syrian lives and let Syrian children grow up in peace and prosperity: Let refugees from this horrific conflict resettle in the US — something Trump is trying to ban completely?

### TITLE: 
With Syria strike, Trump yanked the Russia card out of Democrats’ hands—commentary

### TEXT: 
Instead, those who just want to criticize President Trump and a good number of honestly concerned Americans will now be focused on wondering if pushing back on President Bashar Assad in Syria was worth antagonizing Syria's Russian protectors. That's a much healthier debate because it's almost entirely based in known factual information and not shrouded in mysterious conspiracy theories and innuendo. For example, we still don't know if Russia's public opposition to the attacks is 100 percent honest or just for show, but we do know that the U.S. did inform the Putin regime before launching the attacks. And Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Friday morning that the missile strikes came "within an inch of militarily clashing with Russia." But he ended it there. Medvedev is thus playing the role of the angry uncle many of us have who swears that if his rival had "said ONE MORE WORD, he would have really done something!" In other words, the Russians are folding... for now.

This attack also suddenly puts the Trump team into a more traditional and accepted role for a presidential administration. Almost every president has been involved in ordering some kind of military action, and there's a long tradition of presidents gaining a natural degree of added public support as commander-in-chief when our troops are put into harm's way. Some of that added support has eroded over time, thanks to residual public resentment over the Iraq War, but it still exists. It also seems to be making this president act more presidential, as he gave a heartfelt address to the nation last night instead of tweeting. In fact, he didn't tweet about the attack at all the night of the missile launch or even the morning after.

And that's not the only part of the script that's flipped so suddenly. Because guess who is a de facto supporter of President Trump's decision now? The answer is none other than Hillary Clinton, who called for just this kind of strike on Syrian air bases just hours before they occurred. "I really believe we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them," Clinton said on Thursday afternoon. That's a case of strange bedfellows not many people could have predicted.

Again don't be fooled, President Trump's opponents are still angry as ever and many of them will use this missile attack to form a new series of political attacks against him. But now they have to start over and their range of attack has been significantly narrowed. In fact, in light of President Trump's clear challenge to the Russians, a good case can be made to end the House Intelligence Committee's hearings and ranking member Adam Schiff's crusade to uncover some kind of Trump-Russian grand conspiracy. Something else will catch the Democrats' anti-Trump fancy to be sure, but it will have to be something else.

That "something else" will likely be a continued rehashing of then-private citizen Trump using Twitter and other venues to warn against attacks on Syria and more wars in the Middle East. But we've seen that kind of tactic before used against presidents in the past. The "Trump is a Russian-controlled stooge" was different and unique, especially since concerns over its possible veracity made it all the way to the level of a congressional investigation. So, while we're not flipping the script from nasty to nice, we are getting more into the realm of political normalcy.

### TITLE: 
Donald Trump is charting his path as commander in chief— commentary

### TEXT: 
Donald Trump spent his initial weeks in office promising to make a decisive break from what he described as years of failed Obama administration policies toward Israel, ISIS, China, and Russia — only to basically keep all of Obama's policies in place.

That's over now. After giving the order to bomb Syria after a deadly chemical weapon attack, Trump has begun charting his own path as commander in chief.

The high-risk decision to strike a Syrian military target means that Trump was willing to do something his predecessor would not: bomb a facility controlled by the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for the first time since the country descended into civil war nearly six years ago.

More from Vox:

Here's how leaders around the world are responding to the strike on Syria

West Virginia is legalizing medical marijuana — and it could help deal with its huge opioid crisis

Trump's foreign policy is dangerously impulsive



It's the most significant military move that Trump has authorized as president, and there are three things to note about it — each of which may offer a clue as to what kind of commander in chief Trump will ultimately prove to be.

First, Trump made the decision extraordinarily quickly. Former President Barack Obama had famously warned that the use of chemical weapons would cross a "red line" and trigger a direct US military response, but ultimately shied away from using force even after Assad gassed more than 1,500 people to death in 2013. The Obama administration spent the next three years bitterly divided over whether, or how, to take action against Assad.

Trump had no such compunction. The suspected sarin gas attack that killed 85 Syrians took place Tuesday; the first barrage of US Tomahawk cruise missiles crashed into Syria's al-Shayrat airfield less than three days later.

Second, Trump — despite his harsh rhetoric about how Assad's "heinous" chemical attack was an "affront to humanity" — ultimately ordered an extremely limited military operation. The US hit the airbase with 59 cruise missiles but didn't send in warplanes, armed drones, or other heavier weaponry. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented Trump with an array of military options, some more intensive than others; Trump chose one of the mildest of them.

Third, Trump's late-night statement announcing the strike stressed that it targeted a single, very specific target that was directly tied to the chemical weapons attack.

As my colleague Zack Beauchamp notes, the implication was that Trump has no desire to launch any more strikes unless Assad uses more chemical weapons. If Assad sticks to his normal tactics, and kills children with explosives rather than banned chemicals, then the United States will leave him alone. This attack will, it seems, be a one-off — or at least part of a relatively small battery of punitive strikes.

Trump and his aides may be hoping that the missile strike will add a new sense of urgency to the moribund Syrian peace talks and perhaps even pave the way for Assad's eventual departure.

That will only happen if Russia wants it to; Vladimir Putin is Assad's closest overseas ally and has sent troops, warplanes, and other weaponry into Syria to help Assad maintain his hold on power. Persuading the Kremlin to cut Assad loose will require sustained and sophisticated US diplomatic maneuvering, something neither Trump nor his team have yet shown themselves capable of pulling off.

Trump's Syria dilemma doesn't end just because he bombed an airfield.

There will be other challenges facing Trump in the days and weeks ahead. Assad may try to use chemical weapons again to test Trump's resolve and see if the new president — a mercurial leader known for his impatience — is willing to continually mount pinprick operations that don't seriously change the course of the war.

Key American allies like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, are likely to try to convince Trump that he didn't go far enough and should take much stronger steps against Assad, even at the risk of further escalating the conflict.

For Commander in Chief Trump, in other words, the hard work is just beginning.

If the Fed's right and market valuation needs to come down, it's not necessarily the end of the bull

### TEXT: 
The Federal Reserve March meeting minutes indicated central bank officials are worried the stock market's multiple has become a bit too rich.

"Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical norms," the minutes said. "Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures."

If the Fed is right and the P/E ratio is in for a contraction, it's doesn't necessarily mean the end of the bull market, or even that stocks will decline, history shows. An analysis using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho found the S&P 500 can still manage to rise during annual periods of multiple compression as earnings (the denominator in the P/E ratio) catch up.

The chart below shows the median return of the S&P 500 during years in the last two decades when the index's trailing P/E declined. The compression happened during nine of those years (2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2014). We used a median return because the 40 percent loss in 2008 due to the market price plunge after the financial crisis skews the results. Also included in the chart are the four best sector performers during those years, ranked by median return.

Bond market sending warning signal to the Trump rally

### TEXT: 
Three weeks ago the yield on the 10-year Treasury was above 2.60 percent with the Federal Reserve about to raise rates and various economic surveys indicating confidence surging under President Donald Trump.

But something curious has happened.

The 10-year yield has dropped, trading near 2.30 percent this week as "hard" economic data, such as weak auto sales on Monday, indicate the confidence in a Trump-led economy has yet to translate into a tangible increase in demand.

As the bond market signals worry, stocks have largely held their ground, with the Nasdaq composite index hitting a new high as recently as Monday.

History shows something has to give.

Theoretically, let's say the 10-year yield was to drop another 30 basis points (0.3 percent) to 2 percent in the next month. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, we found there were 35 times in the last decade when the 10-year yield dropped 30 basis points in one month.

The S&P 500, on average, lost nearly 3 percent during those occasions, led by big losses in financials, materials and industrials.

### TEXT: 
President Donald Trump's firing of Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian air base should lift the price of defense stocks past the market benchmark next week, according to a CNBC analysis of historic data.

Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, we looked at the performance of defense stocks and the S&P 500 a week following significant developments in the Syrian civil war. There have been more than 200 major events during the conflict in the last six years, including those involving the U.S., Russia, Turkey, the U.K. and France.

Here is the performance of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF, major defense shares and the S&P 500 a week after such events:

The major defense stocks, including Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk missiles used in Thursday's airstrikes, all beat the market during the week following an escalation of the conflict, on average.

Oil and Treasurys also beat the S&P 500 in the week following an event, yet gold underperforms, according to Kensho.

### TITLE: 
Monster beat in consumer confidence should boost the market, retail stocks, history shows

### TEXT: 
If history is any guide, retail stocks should lead a gain in the U.S. stock market over the next week and month after March's consumer confidence reading blew past the Wall Street consensus Tuesday morning.

The Consumer Confidence Index for March was 125.6, according to the Conference Board, compared with the 114 level expected by economists polled by FactSet. The beat was more than two standard deviations higher than the average surprise. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, we looked at what happened to the S&P 500 and a key retail ETF in the wake of just a one standard deviation beat by the index.

Here's the average performance of the S&P 500 and the SPDR S&P 500 Retail ETF (XRT) one week later.

### TITLE: 
These stocks should take a hit because of Ford's profit warning

### TEXT: 
Ford just came out and warned first-quarter profit would be as low as 30 cents a share, below the 47 cents a share current consensus on Wall Street. The shares were set to open almost 3 percent lower.

The following stocks in the Russell 1000 Index have the highest correlation with Ford over the last 6 months, according to Kensho. So if Ford falls 3 percent, expect these stocks to decline nearly as much.

Traders will use these correlations to their advantage. For example, CNBC's Jim Cramer said after the Ford warning that he would use any weakness in General Motors as a buying opportunity.
