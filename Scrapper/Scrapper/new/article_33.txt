Investors should buy Apple shares as the company's next line of iPhones will drive earnings above Wall Street expectations, according to Atlantic Equities, which reiterated its overweight rating on the tech giant.

"The increase in our estimates is predicated on growing evidence that Apple will launch a premium-priced, redesigned iPhone later this year, alongside upgraded 7s and 7s Plus devices," analyst James Cordwell wrote in a note Friday.
